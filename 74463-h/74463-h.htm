</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The present work is a revised edition of my book on slavery as it was published in
1900.
</p>
<p>Preparing this second edition, I saw that the general plan of the book could remain
the same. The details, however, wanted improvement in many respects. The chapter treating
of the geographical distribution of slavery among savage tribes has been much enlarged,
as the information of which I disposed was far more complete now than when the book
was originally written. The theoretical part, I hope, has also much improved. A closer
study of the subject has led me to alter some passages and make several additions.
</p>
<p>I have also profited by the remarks of my critics, among whom I especially mention
Professor <span class="sc">Tönnies</span> (in Professor <span class="sc">Schmoller’s</span> <i lang="de">Jahrbücher</i>, Vol. XXV) and Dr. <span class="sc">Vierkandt</span> (in <i lang="de">Zeitschrift für Socialwissenschaft</i>, Vol. IV). To these I may add Professor <span class="sc">Westermarck</span>, who, in his work on the origin and development of the moral ideas (1906–08), discusses
at some length the conclusions to which I have arrived.
</p>
<p>The fact that the first edition has been kindly received by the periodical press has
encouraged me to prepare this second edition. I was happy to notice that my study
of some conditions of primitive culture was valued not only as a contribution to the
knowledge of savage life, but as furthering the understanding of the structure of
human society in general.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">VI</a>]</span></p>
<p>I will not conclude this preface without offering my sincere thanks to my teacher
and friend Professor <span class="sc">Steinmetz</span> of Amsterdam, under whose guidance the first edition was written and whose help in
preparing the present edition has been very valuable to me.

</p>
<p class="tocArgument">This book deals with the general character of slavery as an industrial system XV.—We
confine ourselves to the phenomena of savage life XV.—The object of ethnology is not
only to reconstruct the early history of mankind, but to find sociological laws XVI.—Bearing
of the results of ethnological investigation upon the study of social phenomena in
general XVI.—Our method: inductive and comparative XVII.—Ethnographical literature
XVII.—This literature may not be used without a thorough criticism XVII.—“Statistical
method” XVIII.—The facts must serve as a basis whereupon to found theories, not as
mere illustrations of preconceived theories XVIII.—But we cannot do without leading
ideas XIX.—We treat one subject thoroughly instead of many subjects superficially
XIX.—Writers on the general history of slavery XIX.

<p class="tocPart">PART I.—<a href="#pt1">DESCRIPTIVE</a>.
</p>
<p class="tocChapter">CHAPTER I.—<span class="asc"><a href="#ch1.1" id="xd32e221">DEFINITION AND DISTINCTION FROM KINDRED PHENOMENA</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>§ 1. <i><a href="#s1.1.1" id="xd32e228">Ordinary meaning of the term “slavery”</a></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">3</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">It is necessary to know this meaning of the term, as both ethnographers and theorists
use it in this sense 3.—“Slavery of women” and “wage-slaves” 4.—Three characteristics
of slavery 5.
</p>
<p>§ 2. <i><a href="#s1.1.2" id="xd32e239">Use of the term “slavery” in theoretical literature</a></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">6</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">Theorists agree that the chief characteristic of slavery consists in this, that the
slave is the “property” or “possession” of his master.
</p>
<p>§ 3. <i><a href="#s1.1.3" id="xd32e250">Definition for scientific use</a></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">7</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">We want a sociologically practical definition 7.—The function of slavery is a division
of labour 7.—Voluntary and compulsory labour 7.—The slave the property of his master
and compelled to work 8.—“Property” implies compulsory labour 8.—Our definition. Its
advantages 9.
</p>
<p>§ 4. <i><a href="#s1.1.4" id="xd32e262">Distinction of slavery from kindred phenomena</a>. I Wives in an abject condition</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">9</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">“Slavery of women” as spoken of by ethnographers and theorists 9.—Condition of women
among the Australian aborigines. Bad, but not so much so as has sometimes been supposed
10.—Division of labour between the sexes not always so unreasonable as at first sight
it seems 22.—Wives in an abject condition show much resemblance to slaves, but are
not slaves, as their chief function is that of wives and mothers 24.—Slavery proper
does not exist when there are none but female slaves 25.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">VIII</a>]</span></p>
<p>§ 5. <i><a href="#s1.1.5" id="xd32e275">Distinction of slavery from kindred phenomena</a>. II Children subjected to the head of the family</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">26</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">Treatment of children among savages; Dr. Steinmetz’s investigations 26—<i lang="la">Patria potestas</i> and <i lang="la">potestas dominica</i> 28.—Children, though entirely subjected to their father, are not slaves, as they
occupy quite another place in the social system 28.—Adopted children sometimes difficult
to distinguish from slaves 29.—Slavery only exists beyond the limits of the family
proper 30.
</p>
<p>§ 6. <i><a href="#s1.1.6" id="xd32e293">Distinction of slavery from kindred phenomena</a>. III Members of a society in their relation to the head of the community</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">30</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">The subjects “slaves of the king” 30.—A king has never a right of property over his
subjects 31.—Penal servitude occurs in many countries where slavery does not exist
32.—“Property” better than “possession” 32.
</p>
<p>§ 7. <i><a href="#s1.1.7" id="xd32e305">Distinction of slavery from kindred phenomena</a>. IV Subjected tribes; tributary provinces; lower classes; free labourers</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">33</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">“Slave tribes” and “slave districts” inappropriate names for tribes subjected <i>en bloc</i> and tributary districts 33.—Lower classes. The lack of details sometimes prevents
us from determining, whether a labouring class consists of free labourers or slaves
34.
</p>
<p>§ 8. <i><a href="#s1.1.8" id="xd32e319">Distinction of slavery from kindred phenomena</a>. V Serfs</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">34</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">Serfdom in Germany 34.—In France 36.—In Rome (<i lang="la">colonatus</i>) 37.—Opinions of theorists 37.—Serfs are not slaves, because they are not the property,
in the sense of Roman law, of their masters 38.
</p>
<p>§ 9. <i><a href="#s1.1.9" id="xd32e335">Pawns or debtor-slaves</a></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="tocPageNum">39</span>
</p>
<p class="tocArgument">The slave-state of pawns is conditional 39.—Pawns are not in a legal sense the property
of their masters; but we may call them slaves, as they take the same place as other
slaves in the social system 40.

<p class="tocArgument">Stages of culture; Morgan’s and Vierkandt’s classifications 169.—Distinction of savages
according to their general culture as yet impracticable 170.—Assertions about slavery
being universal at some stages of culture 171.—The existence of slavery probably mainly

</p>
<p class="tocArgument">List of positive and negative cases 190.—The large prevalence of negative cases must
be due to general causes 192.—Scarcity of food 192.—Hunting slaves can easily escape
194.—Living in small groups 194.—Hunting not fit to be performed by slaves because
1º hunters are highly esteemed 195,—2º hunting requires the utmost application 197.—Hunters

</p>
<p class="tocArgument">Fishing not nearly so unfavourable to the existence of slavery as hunting 201.—Most
of our positive cases are found on the North Pacific Coast of North America 203.—Circumstances
which may account for the existence of slavery on the Pacific Coast. 1º Abundance
of food 203.—2º Fishing the chief source of subsistence. Variety of food 204.—3º Fixed
habitations, living in large groups, preserving of food 205.—4º Trade and industry
207.—5º Property and wealth 210.—The growth of slavery accelerated by these tribes
forming a somewhat homogeneous group 214.—Work imposed on slaves. 1º They strengthen
their masters’ force in warfare 215.—2º They are employed in hunting, fishing, and
work connected with fishing 215.—3º They make canoes and build houses 217.—4º They
perform domestic labour 217.—Why female labour is so highly valued 218.—Women prepare
the articles of commerce 218.—Women hold a high position 219.—Dr. Grosse on the condition

</p>
<p class="tocArgument">We want to prove that the circumstances furthering slavery on the Pacific Coast of
N. America are wanting among the other hunters and fishers 227.—We confine ourselves
to the three great groups: Australians, Indians of Central North America, and Eskimos
228.—Aboriginal life in Australia. 1º No abundance of food 228.—2º Variety of food.
Fishing not the chief source of subsistence 229.—3º No fixed habitations, small groups,
little food preserved. Improvidence of the Australians 229.—4º Trade and industry

habitations, rather small groups, food preserved though not to such an extent as on
the Pacific Coast 237.—4º Trade and industry signify little 239.—5º Property and wealth
are little developed 240.—6º Condition of women better than in Australia, but not

<p class="tocArgument">1º No great abundance of food 246.—2º Fishing their chief source of subsistence 247.—3º
Fixed habitations, groups not very large, food preserved though not in such great
quantities as on the Pacific Coast 247.—4º The trade exists almost exclusively in
exchanging raw products. Industry highly developed 248.—5º Property and wealth do
not signify much 250.—6º Condition of women not so good as on the Pacific Coast 251.—7º
Militarism does not prevail to any considerable extent 252.—Only highly skilled labour
wanted 253.—Labour dependent upon capital 254.

seems convenient to systematically arrange them 256.—Principal factors: 1º Subsistence
is or is not dependent on capital, 2º Subsistence is either easy or difficult to acquire
256.—Secondary factors: 1º Condition of women 258.—2º Preserving of food 259.—3º Trade

does not require much labour; the men are often very lazy 273.—Among the Larbas pastoral
life is not so easy; but it is warriors who are wanted here, rather than labourers

<h2 class="main">GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There exists an extensive literature on slavery. Many of these works are intended
for philanthropic purposes, viz. to further the suppression of the African slave-trade,
whereas many others contain historical investigations of slavery among ancient or
modern nations.
</p>
<p>The present volume will not rank among either of these categories, but deal with the
general character of slavery as an industrial system. Slavery has played a great part
in the social history of mankind. Social life among most of the ancient nations was
based upon slavery, and in many colonies it subsisted until far into the 19<sup>th</sup> century. On the other hand, in the civilized countries of to-day all industrial operations
are carried on with free labour. Whence this difference? Why have slavery and serfdom
gradually declined in the course of European history, so that at the close of the
Middle Ages they had already in a large degree lost their significance? These problems
can only be solved if we know the conditions necessary for the success of slavery
as an industrial system, and the inverse conditions under which slave labour must
give way to free labour. We shall try to find these conditions, or at least some of
them.
</p>
<p>We shall use the comparative method, collecting facts and inquiring what regularities
can be found in these facts, under what general rules they may be included. But before
enlarging upon our method we must say a few words concerning a limitation we have
put upon our subject.
</p>
<p>Our book, as the title shows, contains ethnological researches. We confine ourselves
to investigating the conditions which govern the existence or non-existence of slavery
among savage tribes, and the materials we make use of are exclusively ethnographical
materials, <i>i.e.</i> descriptions of savage tribes.
</p>
<p>Ethnology has already made considerable progress, and is taking a conspicuous place
among the Mental Sciences. Yet some ethnologists still proceed in a somewhat narrow
and one-sided manner. They generally aim at reconstructing the early history of mankind
with the help of <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvi">[<a href="#pb.xvi">XVI</a>]</span>ethnographical data. The savages representing primitive man, or at least man in a
more primitive state than we can find by direct historical research, they draw inferences
from the actual state of savage tribes as to the early state of mankind at large.
This kind of study has been very useful, especially in removing narrow views on human
development which existed at a time, when the traditions of a few ancient nations
were still considered to be the only evidence as to early history. But this should
not be the sole, nor even the main object of ethnological investigation. It is sociological
laws that we want in the first place. It is certainly interesting to know what changes
have taken place in early history; but it is far more important to know on what circumstances
the existence of each social phenomenon depends. And for this purpose ethnology can
be of considerable use. Among savages social life is much simpler than among civilized
men; the factors which govern it are comparatively few, and so the effect of each
of them can be traced without much difficulty. We can thus, by comparing the institutions
of many savage tribes, find sociological laws, several of which will have a wider
application and lead us to a clearer understanding of the conditions which govern
the social life of civilized nations. For instance, the study of moral phenomena among
savages has already given us a deeper insight into morality at large.
</p>
<p>The conclusions we arrive at in this book are of two kinds. Some of them apply to
savages only and cannot further our understanding of civilized life. For instance,
we shall see that settled tribes are more likely to keep slaves than nomadic tribes;
but civilized, and even semi-civilized peoples are hardly ever nomadic. Other conclusions,
however, have a more general bearing. Thus we shall find that slavery is not likely
to exist in those countries, where all land is held as property. And as this has been
the case in Western Europe for some centuries, we discover one of the principal causes,
perhaps the main cause, why slavery (and serfdom, which is a mitigated form of slavery),
have long since disappeared in these countries.
</p>
<p>We do not, however, make any systematic inquiry into the bearing of the laws found
by investigating the phenomena of savage life on the study of social life among civilized
and semi-civilized nations. Where phenomena of civilized life occur to us which bear
a striking resemblance to what we find among savages, we mention them briefly, generally
in a note. Only in one case we go farther. Where we find that the relation between
land and population is a factor of the utmost importance in shaping the lot of the
labouring classes, it is obvious that this factor must have played a great part in
the social history of Europe, and therefore we adduce some statements of historians
in corroboration of our view. Yet, even here, it is our object to claim attention
for this factor that is commonly overlooked, and clear the way for future research,
rather <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvii">[<a href="#pb.xvii">XVII</a>]</span>than to give a ready explanation of the decline of serfdom in Western Europe. We are
thus justified in making use of only a small part of the literature on this subject.
</p>
<p>As we have already said, we proceed by an inductive, comparative method. We first
collect ethnographical materials. Then we critically determine the meaning and reliability
of the statements of our informants. We thus see where slavery exists, and where it
is absent. And finally we inquire what are the causes of the observed phenomena.
</p>
<p>Some remarks have still to be made on the details of our proceeding. First as to the
ethnographical literature.
</p>
<p>We have collected our materials quite impartially, without any regard to our ultimate
conclusions, which, indeed, rest upon a study of the facts, not upon any preconceived
opinion. Though there is, of course, much ethnographical literature we have not used,
our collection is rather extensive and contains most of the better works. All geographical
groups are properly represented, least of all perhaps India, most of the literature
on which country (so far as wild tribes are concerned) seems to be wanting in the
Dutch libraries. We have greatly profited by being allowed to make use of Professor
Steinmetz’s schedules, being detailed extracts of hundreds of ethnographical books
and articles, somewhat resembling Spencer’s “Descriptive Sociology”, but far more
complete.
</p>
<p>The ethnographical literature may not, however, be used without a thorough criticism.
We shall often meet with very loose and inaccurate statements, and this book will
afford many instances of the careless use of the terms “slave” and “slavery” by ethnographers.
The zoölogist and the geologist have only to deal with accounts of their fellow-scientists;
but the ethnologist is obliged always to rely on ethnographers, who often have no
notion of ethnology, and sometimes no notion of science at all. Hence the very bad
terminology; hence also the frequent omission of details which would have been very
valuable. Yet, regarding the very little that has as yet been achieved in ethnology,
we can hardly blame the ethnographers. It is true, if the ethnographical literature
were better, ethnology would greatly profit by it; but, on the other hand, even with
the help of the existing literature, which, after all, is not so very bad, much more
might be attained than is actually done. And as long as ethnology is still in an unsettled
condition, it is perhaps better that an ethnographer should have no ideas at all on
ethnological subjects, than premature, quasi-scientific, and probably erroneous ideas.
Montaigne, one of the most sensible men who have ever lived, speaking of his informant
on the cannibals of America, says: “This man whom I had was a simple and rude man,
which is a condition conducive to reliable testimony; for refined people observe more
curiously and observe more things; but then they gloss them; and in order to force
their interpretation on you, they <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xviii">[<a href="#pb.xviii">XVIII</a>]</span>cannot but change the story a little; they never represent you the pure facts; they
warp and mask them according to the point of view from which they regard them; and
in order to give credit to their judgment and make you accept their view, they readily
add something to the matter on that side and exaggerate it. A man must be either very
truthful, or so simple that he does not want to construct false inventions and give
them a semblance of truth, and is not riveted to a theory.” What we want is, as the
same writer has it, <i lang="fr">la matière de l’histoire nue et informe</i><a class="noteRef" id="nxviii.1src" href="#nxviii.1">1</a>. An ethnographer should be taught what to observe and how to observe, and how to
record his observations. But when this ideal cannot be attained, it is better to have
an ethnographer who only knows that every correct statement of his will interest the
men of science, than one whose perceptive faculties are troubled by preconceived opinions.
</p>
<p>We have subjected our materials to a thorough criticism, externally by comparing in
each case the descriptions of the same tribe by different writers, and internally
by inquiring what importance is to be attached to the statements of each writer, considering
the time in which he wrote, his more or less intimate acquaintance with the people
described, the general character of his writings, etc.
</p>
<p>We thus find where slavery exists or formerly existed, and where it does or did not
exist. We always mention the exact numbers of the tribes with and without slaves in
the several geographical groups, and afterwards also in the several economic groups.
We do not intend these numbers as statistical materials, upon which to base mathematical
rules. We only mean to express the results of our investigations in the exactest manner
possible. Instead of stating: Slavery in such a group exists in many cases, it is
much more accurate to state: Slavery in such a group exists, so far as our observations
go, in, say, 80 cases. We thus simply follow the method (sometimes miscalled statistical
method) first introduced by Professor Tylor in his article “On a method of investigating
the development of institutions”, and adopted by Professor Steinmetz in his “<i lang="de">Entwicklung der Strafe</i>”.
</p>
<p>We inquire next what conditions govern the occurrence of the observed phenomena. This
part of our work is certainly the most difficult, and it is necessary here to proceed
with the utmost caution. Many ethnologists adopt a rather curious method. They have
some theory, found by deductive reasoning, and then adduce a few facts by way of illustration.
This, however, is quite insufficient. It does not appear whether all existing facts
agree with the theory; there may be many instances, not mentioned by the theorist,
in which his rule does not hold. The only scientific method is impartially to collect
facts and inquire whether they can be brought <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xix">[<a href="#pb.xix">XIX</a>]</span>under any general rule. If we find a hypothesis that accounts for many, but not all,
of the observed phenomena, our task is not finished until we have explained the rest
by showing the influence of additional factors. Moreover, the negative instances must
be accounted for as well as the positive. If we account for the existence of B by
the coexistence of A, we must prove either that in those cases where B does not exist
A too is absent, or that in such cases there are additional causes which neutralize
the effect of A. Ethnological works should not be <i>causeries</i>, as they often are, but scientific researches.
</p>
<p>But we must also be careful not to fall into the other extreme. We shall never be
able to arrive at a true understanding of the facts without the help of leading ideas.
The facts do not arrange themselves spontaneously; we must try to account for them
by hypotheses which seem <i>a priori</i> plausible. When such a hypothesis occurs to us, we have to inquire how far it can
go to account for the facts, and, of course, to abandon it if, however plausible it
seemed, it proves to be erroneous. By judiciously selecting our hypotheses we can
save ourselves much futile labour. For instance, when about to investigate the causes
of slavery, it occurs to us that its existence will probably largely depend on the
economic state of society, and we inquire whether this be really so. If we began with
investigating the effect of some factor that <i>a priori</i> seems to have little connection with slavery, <i>e.g.</i> the development of aesthetic sentiments, we should be almost certain to do useless
work.
</p>
<p>The present volume endeavours to come up to the ideal we have set ourselves and developed
here. A book of the same size as this might contain a survey of many more subjects
connected with slavery. In the last paragraph it will be shown how very much remains
unsaid. We treat only a small portion of the subject of slavery. But this portion
is treated carefully, and by doing so we think we have arrived at some conclusions
of scientific value, whereas, if we had superficially treated a wider subject, our
work, though perhaps more agreeable from a literary point of view, would be nearly
useless in a scientific sense.
</p>
<p>Slavery among savages has never yet been made the subject of any special investigation.
Letourneau’s “<i lang="fr">Évolution de l’Esclavage</i>” treats of slavery among all races of mankind, savages included. But he deals with
his subject in quite an insufficient manner. His literature is rather scanty, and
there is no question of any critical inquiry into the value of his materials. The
theoretical part of his work consists of some entirely unproved assertions; not a
single systematic investigation is to be found in it. Hence his general conclusion
is very meagre and contains only the hackneyed evolutionary series of slavery,—serfdom,—wage-system,—socialist
paradise, to which he adds “slavery of women” as the very first stage. The scientific
value of this book is very little.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xx">[<a href="#pb.xx">XX</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is another book dealing with the general history of slavery, Professor J.&nbsp;K.
Ingram’s “History of slavery and serfdom”. This writer confines himself to the historical
nations of ancient and modern times; the savages are excluded. Though he makes many
valuable remarks, of which, as the reader will see, we have availed ourselves, by
far the greater part of his work is purely descriptive. A great difference between
his book and ours is further that he writes “not for scholars, but for the mass of
thoughtful and cultivated men and women”<a class="noteRef" id="nxx.1src" href="#nxx.1">2</a>, whereas we appeal to the men of <span class="corr" id="xd32e1049" title="Source: sience">science</span>, not to the public at large. Yet it is an instructive little book. We only regret
that the writer appears to agree with Comte’s curious theory concerning the relation
between slavery and religion<a class="noteRef" id="nxx.2src" href="#nxx.2">3</a>.
</p>
<p>The general history of slavery is also the subject of a book of Tourmagne’s. “There
are two volumes by A. Tourmagne,” says Ingram<span class="corr" id="xd32e1057" title="Not in source">,</span> “entitled respectively <i lang="fr">Histoire de l’Esclavage Ancien et Moderne</i>, 1880, and <i lang="fr">Histoire du Servage Ancien et Moderne</i>, 1879, which bring together many facts relating to slavery and serfdom; but they
are somewhat loose and uncritical; the author, too, repeats himself much, and dwells
on many topics scarcely, if at all, connected with his main themes”<a class="noteRef" id="nxx.3src" href="#nxx.3">4</a>. We are not acquainted with <span class="corr" id="xd32e1068" title="Source: Tourmagne">Tourmagne’s</span> book on serfdom: but as to his <i lang="fr">Histoire de l’Esclavage</i> we fully agree with Ingram.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 1.</span> <i>Ordinary meaning of the term “slavery”.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In most branches of knowledge the phenomena the man of science has to deal with have
their technical names; and, when using a scientific term, he need not have regard
to the meaning this term conveys in ordinary language; he knows he will not be misunderstood
by his fellow-scientists. For instance, the Germans call a whale <i lang="de">Wallfisch</i>, and the English speak of shell-fish; but a zoölogist, using the word fish, need
not fear that any competent person will think he means whales or shell-fish.
</p>
<p>In ethnology the state of things is quite different. There are a few scientific names
bearing a definite meaning, such as the terms “animism” and “survival”, happily introduced
by Professor Tylor. But most phenomena belonging to our science have not yet been
accurately investigated; so it is no wonder, that different writers (sometimes even
the same writer on different pages) give different names to the same phenomenon, whereas
on the other hand sometimes the same term (<i>e.g.</i> “matriarchy”) is applied to widely different phenomena. As for the subject we are
about to treat of, we shall presently see that several writers have given a definition
of slavery; but no one has taken the trouble to inquire whether his definition can
be of any practical use in social science. Therefore we shall try to give a good definition
and justify it.
</p>
<p>But we may not content ourselves with this; we must also pay attention to the meaning
of the term “slavery” as commonly employed. There are two reasons for this. First,
we <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>must always rely upon the statements of ethnographers. If an ethnographer states that
some savage tribe carries on slavery, without defining in what this “slavery” consists,
we have to ask: What may our informant have meant? And as he is likely to have used
the word in the sense generally attached to it, we have to inquire: What is the ordinary
meaning of the term “slavery”?
</p>
<p>The second reason is this. Several theoretical writers speak of slavery, without defining
what they mean by it; and we cannot avail ourselves of their remarks without knowing
what meaning they attach to this term. And as they too may be supposed to have used
it in the sense in which it is generally used, we have again to inquire: What is the
meaning of the term “slavery” in ordinary language?
</p>
<p>The general use of the word, as is so often the case, is rather inaccurate. “Careless
or rhetorical writers” says Ingram, <span class="corr" id="xd32e1108" title="Not in source">“</span>use the words “slave” and “slavery” in a very lax way. Thus, when protesting against
the so-called “Subjection of Women”, they absurdly apply those terms to the condition
of the wife in the modern society of the west—designations which are inappropriate
even in the case of the inmates of Indian zenanas; and they speak of the modern worker
as a “wage-slave”, even though he is backed by a powerful trade-union. Passion has
a language of its own, and poets and orators must doubtless be permitted to denote
by the word “slavery” the position of subjects of a state who labour under civil disabilities,
or are excluded from the exercise of political power, but in sociological study things
ought to have their right names, and those names should, as far as possible, be uniformly
employed”<a class="noteRef" id="n4.1src" href="#n4.1">1</a>.
</p>
<p>But this use of the word we may safely regard as a metaphor<a class="noteRef" id="n4.2src" href="#n4.2">2</a>; nobody will assert that these labourers and women are really slaves. Whoever uses
the term slavery in its ordinary sense attaches a fairly distinct idea to it.
</p>
<p>What is this idea?
</p>
<p>We can express it most generally thus: a slave is one who <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>is not free. There are never slaves without there being freemen too; and nobody can
be at the same time a slave and a freeman. We must, however, be careful to remember
that, man being a “social animal”, no man is literally free; all members of a community
are restricted in their behaviour towards each other by social rules and customs<a class="noteRef" id="n5.1src" href="#n5.1">3</a>. But freemen at any rate are relatively free; so a slave must be one who does not
share in the common amount of liberty, compatible with the social connection.
</p>
<p>The condition of the slave as opposed to that of the freeman presents itself to us
under the three following aspects.
</p>
<p>First, every slave has his master to whom he is subjected. And this subjection is
of a peculiar kind. Unlike the authority one freeman sometimes has over another, the
master’s power over his slave is unlimited, at least in principle; any restriction
put upon the master’s free exercise of his power is a mitigation of slavery, not belonging
to its nature, just as in Roman law the proprietor may do with his property whatever
he is not by special laws forbidden to do. The relation between master and slave is
therefore properly expressed by the slave being called the master’s “possession” or
“property”, expressions we frequently meet with.
</p>
<p>Secondly, slaves are in a lower condition as compared with freemen. The slave has
no political rights; he does not choose his government, he does not attend the public
councils. Socially he is despised.
</p>
<p>In the third place, we always connect with slavery the idea of compulsory labour.
The slave is compelled to work; the free labourer may leave off working if he likes,
be it at the cost of starving. All compulsory labour, however, is not slave labour;
the latter requires that peculiar kind of compulsion, that is expressed by the word
“possession” or “property”, as has been said before.
</p>
<p>Recapitulating, we may define a slave in the ordinary sense of the word as a man who
is the property of another, politically and socially at a lower level than the mass
of the people, and performing compulsory labour.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>We shall inquire next, whether this notion is a practical one for the purpose of our
investigation, or whether it requires any improvement. But it may be convenient first
to examine, what our theoretical authors have to say on the subject.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spencer remarks: “[The captives] fall into unqualified servitude.… They belong absolutely
to their captors.… They become property, of which any use whatever may be made”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.1src" href="#n6.1">4</a>. Although this may not properly be called a definition of slavery, it appears that
he uses “becoming property” and “falling into unqualified servitude” (or slavery)
as synonymous expressions.
</p>
<p>According to Ingram “the essential character of slavery may be regarded as lying in
the fact that the master was owner of the person of the slave”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.2src" href="#n6.2">5</a>.
</p>
<p>Lippert remarks: “The fact, that one man becomes an object of possession by another,
characterizes the nature of slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.3src" href="#n6.3">6</a>.
</p>
<p>Sohm calls a slave “a man who is not regarded as a person, but as a thing. The slave
is left to the discretion of the master, who has over him the right of property”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.4src" href="#n6.4">7</a>.
</p>
<p>Letourneau says: “The rights of the masters over their slaves were always excessive;
they were those of a proprietor over his possession”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.5src" href="#n6.5">8</a>.
</p>
<p>According to Schmoller “the slave is the property of his master”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.6src" href="#n6.6">9</a>.
</p>
<p>In the same way, Meyer, speaking of slavery, says that ancient law recognised an unlimited
right of property over men<a class="noteRef" id="n6.7src" href="#n6.7">10</a>.
</p>
<p>Jhering also remarks that “the master’s <i lang="la">potestas</i> may be called property”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.8src" href="#n6.8">11</a>.
</p>
<p>In the first paragraph three principal features of slavery have been enumerated. We
see that our theorists attach most importance to the first feature: “property” or
“possession”<a class="noteRef" id="n6.9src" href="#n6.9">12</a>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>Whether we can agree with them will be shown in the next paragraph.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 3.</span> <i>Definition for scientific use.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The present investigation is a sociological one; therefore our definition of slavery
has to be sociologically relevant. We have to ask: What is the social value of slavery?
Slavery is an organ in the social body performing a certain function, and we have
to inquire: How is this organ developed, and how, in the various stages of its development,
does it perform its function? But then we must know first what this organ and its
function are. Thus only can we exclude from our inquiry organs somewhat resembling
slavery, but functionally quite different from it, and organs wholly different from
slavery, but performing the same function or nearly the same. And this is necessary;
for the inclusion of such organs would create a confusion fatal to a right understanding.
</p>
<p>What then is slavery and what is its function?
</p>
<p>The great function of slavery can be no other than a <i>division of labour</i><a class="noteRef" id="n7.1src" href="#n7.1">13</a>. Division of labour is taken here in the widest sense, as including not only a qualitative
division, by which one man does one kind of work and another a different kind, but
also a quantitative one, by which one man’s wants are provided for not by his own
work only, but by another’s, A society without any division of labour would be one,
in which each man worked for his own wants, and nobody for another’s; in any case
but this there is a division of labour in this wider sense of the word. Now this division
can be brought about by two means. “There are two ways” says Puchta, “in which we
can avail ourselves of the strength of other men which we are in need of. One is the
way of free commerce, that does not interfere with the liberty of the person who serves
us, the making of contracts by which we exchange the strength and skill of another,
or their products, for other performances <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>on our part: hire of services, purchase of manufactures, etc. The other way is the
subjection of such persons, which enables us to dispose of their strength in our behalf,
but at the same time injures the personality of the subjected. This subjection can
be imagined as being restricted to certain purposes, for instance to the cultivation
of the land, as with soil-tilling serfs; the result of which is that this subjection,
for the very reason that is has a definite and limited aim, does not quite annul the
liberty of the subjected. But the subjection can also be an unlimited one, as is the
case when the subjected person, in the whole of his outward life, is treated as but
a means to the purposes of the man of power, and so his personality is entirely absorbed.
This is the institution of slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n8.1src" href="#n8.1">14</a>. We have not much to add to this lucid description of slavery and its function. The
function is a system of compulsory labour, and slavery is the absorption of the whole
personality of the forced labourer to this end. As this absorption is properly expressed
by the word “property” or “possession”, we may define the slave as <i>a man who is the property or possession of another man, and forced to work for him</i>.
</p>
<p>This definition, however, on further consideration will show itself capable of some
simplification. For when one man is the property of another, this implies compulsory
labour. The right of property in this case, the object of it being a man, is a power
over that man’s will too. The Romans recognised this: “The master has not only a right
of property over the slave as over a lifeless thing, but also a power like that over
his son, the <i lang="la">potestas dominica</i>, that is a power over the slave’s will”<a class="noteRef" id="n8.2src" href="#n8.2">15</a>. The right of property, that is a legally unlimited power over a man, were useless,
if the owner did not influence the man’s will; and this influencing is equivalent
to imposing labour upon him, labour being taken in the widest sense. A mere physical
possession, such as the preserving of captives for cannibal purposes, which Letourneau
and Spencer make so much of<a class="noteRef" id="n8.3src" href="#n8.3">16</a>, is socially of little consequence. Possession of human beings, as a social institution,
is that which gets hold <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>of the will of its object. Hence it follows, that <i>slavery is the fact that one man is the property or possession of another</i>.
</p>
<p>This simplification of our formula has this advantage that, in inquiring whether in
any country there are slaves, we need not ask whether there is labour imposed on subjected
men. When this does not sufficiently appear, we need not say: We do not know whether
slavery really exists here. When we are told that in such a country some men are the
property of others (except of course the cases of mere physical possession we have
hinted at, which are few and easy to recognise), we may be sure that they perform
some kind of compulsory labour, and are justified in calling them slaves.
</p>
<p>Further advantages of our definition are, that it is the definition given by many
theorists, and that it lies within the limits of current speech.
</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs we shall mark the distinction of slavery from some phenomena
which somewhat resemble it. Of phenomena of this kind we shall consider only those
that most frequently occur; other questionable cases will be examined in surveying
the occurrence of slavery in the several parts of the globe.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 4.</span> <i>Distinction of slavery from kindred phenomena.</i></h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>I. Wives in an abject condition.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the first paragraph it has already been noticed, that the advocates of women’s
rights make very great use of the term “slavery”. We shall see that this equally applies
to some ethnographers and theorists describing the state of women, especially as wives,
in some primitive societies. To give one instance of each of them: Bancroft says of
the Northern Californians: “Although I find no description of an actual system of
slavery existing among them, yet there is no doubt that they have slaves. We shall
see … that women entitled by courtesy wives, are bought and sold”<a class="noteRef" id="n9.1src" href="#n9.1">17</a>. The theorist we shall quote is Letourneau: “In all very primitive societies woman
represents the domestic <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>animals, the beasts of burden which the more advanced societies possess: she is indeed
treated as a slave, and this certainly is one of the reasons why slavery has been
instituted so late in the course of social evolution”<a class="noteRef" id="n10.1src" href="#n10.1">18</a>.
</p>
<p>We may say that such authors use the word metaphorically (as Letourneau certainly
does); but this does not exempt us from examining, whether the condition of wives
in those cases, where according to them it so much resembles slavery, is really slavery.
We must not, of course, inquire whether there are instances of female slaves being
the wives of their owners, but whether in any case <i>the</i> wives as such are slaves. In doing this, we may confine ourselves to observing the
condition of wives among the natives of Australia, as this condition is commonly described
as a striking instance of an abject one. Letourneau remarks: “In the Australian clans
slavery, in the sense in which we use the word, did not exist; but one half of the
social group, the weaker half, was reduced to servitude; the Australian woman, an
indispensable and despised helpmate, was during her whole life burdened with work,
ill-used, and in reward often eaten by those whom her unavailing labour had fed”<a class="noteRef" id="n10.2src" href="#n10.2">19</a>. Schurtz states that the treatment of the Australian wives is bad<a class="noteRef" id="n10.3src" href="#n10.3">20</a>. Ratzel expresses the same view: “The position of the wife in such circumstances
is always a low one. That she is positively considered to be the property of her husband
(hence in the Adelaide district “owner of a wife” means husband) is not peculiar to
Australia. But to this a number of customs are added here, that, more than among other
peoples to which the notion of the wife as a commodity is equally familiar, place
her in the back-ground of public and even of family life”<a class="noteRef" id="n10.4src" href="#n10.4">21</a>.
</p>
<p>Now let us cite some particulars about this abject state of the Australian wives,
as given by ethnographers. For the purpose of enabling the reader to take a comprehensive
view of the matter, we shall arrange these particulars not according to the different
tribes each applies to, but according to the several phenomena bearing on the object
of our inquiry. This gives the following result:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>A. <i>The wife is acquired by the husband without her consent being asked.</i> So among the Dieri: “under no circumstances has a woman any say in the choice of
a partner”. Powell’s Creek natives: “After being purchased or captured, the woman
is generally taken away to a distance and kept more or less isolated with her husband
for some months, until she contentedly settles down to the new order of things”. Queenslanders
on Herbert River: wives are acquired by bethrothal as children, by exchange for a
sister or daughter or by capture. N.&nbsp;W. Central Queenslanders: the marriage can be
proposed by the male relatives of the woman, or a man can exchange his true blood-sister,
<i>i.e.</i> by the same mother, for another’s blood-sister; in both cases the consent of the
whole camp-council is required. Aborigines of N.&nbsp;S. Wales: girls are often betrothed
in infancy, or else given away by their father or brother without their wishes being
consulted; “the women are considered an article of property, and are sold or given
away by the parents or relatives without the least regard to their own wishes”. Natives
of the Western District of Victoria: betrothal of children is very frequent. A girl
when adult can be asked of her father, without any attention being paid to her wishes.
When two young men have each a sister or cousin, they may exchange the young women
and marry them; the women are obliged to obey. Southern Australians: the husband most
often acquires his wife by means of a contract with her father. Southern Australians
of Port Lincoln: girls are betrothed long before puberty; when adult they must follow
their intended husbands whether they wish it or not. Tribes of Central Australia (described
by Spencer and Gillen): the most usual method of obtaining a wife is that which is
connected with the custom of <i>Tualcha mura</i>, <i>i.e.</i> an agreement between two men that the relationship shall be established between their
two children, one a boy and the other a girl. S.&nbsp;W. Australians: “In no case is the
girl asked for her consent”. Natives of King George Sound (W. Australia): a girl is
often promised to a man years before her birth, but generally she is acquired by capture.
Northern Australians of Port Darwin and the W. Coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria: “Wives
are obtained by gifts of parents; in the majority of cases female children when born
are promised to <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>men of all ages.… Some men obtain women by stealing them, generally from other tribes,
or get them in exchange for a sister”. Tasmanians: the girls are betrothed as children;
before marriage they are the property of their father or brother. When the match is
broken off, the girl is again betrothed, without her wishes being consulted. Brough
Smyth, speaking of the Australians in general, remarks: “Men obtain wives by a convenient
system of exchange, by conquest sometimes, and sometimes a woman is stolen. By what
mode soever a man procures a bride, it is very seldom an occasion of rejoicing for
the female”. And Thomas says: “The process of acquiring a bride differs in different
tribes; she may be exchanged for a sister, the simplest and perhaps the commonest
form; she may be betrothed at, or even, provisionally, before, birth, but this is
usually part of a process of barter; she may be <span class="corr" id="xd32e1296" title="Source: obducted">abducted</span>, either from an already existing, or a prospective husband, or from her relatives;
or she may be inherited from a brother or tribal kinsman”.
</p>
<p>B. <i>The wife is entirely in the power of her husband, and treated accordingly.</i>
</p>
<p>a. Sometimes such <i>general expressions</i> are found, as the wife being her husband’s “<i>property</i>” or “<i>slave</i>”. So on Moreton Bay: wives are slaves. On Herbert River: wives are slaves. In N.&nbsp;S.
Wales: “the woman is the absolute property of her husband”. In S.&nbsp;W. Australia: “the
state of slavery in which they [the women] are all held, is really deplorable.” In
Central Australia: the wife is desired by the husband only for a slave. In Tasmania:
the women are slaves and do all the menial work. We may add Curr’s statement about
the Australians in general: The wife “is not the relative, but the property of her
husband”. “The husband is the absolute owner of his wife (or wives)”. Brough Smyth
too remarks that the husband is called the owner of the wife.
</p>
<p>b. <i>He treats her with contempt.</i> In S. Australia women are despised. In the Moore River District of W. Australia the
husband gives his wife only the offal of the chase. Central Australian men “eat alone,
and throw what they can’t eat to the women”. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales “as her husband walks
along, she follows him at a respectful distance.… If they sit down to <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>a meal, she still keeps behind and gets her share flung to her without ceremony”.
</p>
<p>c. <i>He may sometimes ill-use and even kill her.</i> On Moreton Bay the wife is often beaten by her husband, especially when he is drunk
with rum. The Queenslander of Herbert River “treats his wife with but little consideration,
is often very cruel; he may take her life if he desires”. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales the husband
“may do with her whatever he likes, even to the extent of putting her to death, without
any challenge from social or tribal law.” “The waddy(club) is applied to their heads
in a most unmerciful style, and few old women are to be seen who do not bear unquestionable
marks of the hard usage they have received.” The Cammarray beats his wife violently
for a trifling fault even a few hours before her confinement. Dawson speaks of the
“apparent hard usage to which the women [of W. Victoria] are subjected”. In S.&nbsp;W.
Australia the method <span class="corr" id="xd32e1321" title="Not in source">“</span>he [the husband] adopts for correcting her is so barbarous, that it often occurs that
for a single look he pierces her leg with the <i>ghici</i>, breaks her head with the <i>dauac</i>, and treats her to other similar caresses”. The natives of King George Sound treat
their wives very badly. In the Moore River District most of the women die a violent
death before they have reached an advanced age. If, after an unsuccessful chase, the
husband finds that his wife has not enough yams, she is glad to get off with only
a flogging. In cases of famine the women are eaten. In Central Australia women are
very badly and roughly treated. Nobody aids an ill-used woman. “If … rightly or wrongly,
a man thinks his wife guilty of a breach of the laws which govern marital relations,
then undoubtedly the treatment of the woman is marked by brutal and often revolting
severity.” Tasmanian wives were often cruelly beaten by their jealous husbands. According
to Curr, the Australian husband may “treat her well, or brutally ill-use her, at his
pleasure.” The wives “are, occasionally, cruelly beaten, or speared, for even a trifling
offence”. Brough Smyth states that “if she shows favour towards another and be discovered,
she may suffer heavy punishment, be put to death even”. And, according to Thomas,
“an erring wife might be clubbed or speared through the leg on the spot by her husband,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>no one would take much notice of the incident. Indeed, the injured husband might actually
kill her.”
</p>
<p>d. <i>The husband exchanges and lends his wife.</i> At Powell’s Creek wives are sometimes exchanged. In Queensland and S. Australia “it
frequently occurs, that a woman is exchanged, and passes to a number of husbands in
a few years”. The Moreton Bay aborigines lend their wives to each other and offer
them to Europeans. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales “when visitors come to the camp they are accommodated
with wives while they remain; and a brave chief, who has done much for their tribe
by his prowess, gets the wives of other men sent to him by them as a mark of respect
and friendship. Two men may even agree to exchange wives for a time”. “They will frequently
give one of their wives to a friend who may be in want of one.” At Port Lincoln the
men frequently exchange wives. The S. Australian husband offers his wife to friends
and strangers. Exchange of wives also occurs in S. Australia. In Central Australia
the husband lends his wife to his friends. When he goes abroad a husband is given
her for the time. A guest is also provided with a wife. Men and parents prostitute
their wives and daughters. “At times a man will lend his wife to a stranger as an
act of courtesy”. Another writer informs us that “they often bring them [their wives]
up to white men and beg of them to take them”. The natives of Port Darwin “exchange
wives occasionally”. Tasmanian women were offered to whites for payment. A describer
of the Australians in general states that the husband may “keep her to himself, prostitute
her, exchange her for another, or give her away to any male of the same class as himself”.
According to another writer a young man who has no wife sometimes gets one from an
old man, who is tired of her. And Thomas states: “The Australians were accustomed
to lend their wives to strangers on festive occasions or during ordinary visits. They
might even agree to exchange wives for a month”.
</p>
<p>e. <i>After his death she becomes the property of his brother.</i> Among the Dieri “the elder brother claims her as she is the wife of his brother”.
On Herbert River the widow belongs to the deceased man’s brother. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales “when
a man dies, his widow is the property of his next brother”. Among the <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>Kurnai the same custom prevails. In N. Australia “a widow belongs to her late husband’s
brother”. We may add Curr’s general statement that “when a man dies, his widows devolve
on his eldest surviving brother”.
</p>
<p>C. <i>The husband makes his wife work for him.</i> As regards the Dieri we are told that “the more wives a man has, the more indolent
he becomes; as they do not till the soil, each wife has to go daily in search of food,
gather seeds, roots, and other vegetable products according to the seasons; the men
with a plurality of wives stay at home making weapons, ornaments and fishing nets
from rushes grown on the banks of the lakes”. At Powell’s Creek “polygamy is common,
more so amongst the old men, who find a plurality of wives useful in hunting for them,
and as carriers when shifting camp, etc.”. On Herbert River the women procure the
food, and for this often make long journeys; they do all the hard work. The husband
makes the frame of the hut; she covers it. When travelling she carries all that is
to be carried. The husband often keeps the animal food to himself; his hunting has
rather the character of a sport; the procuring of food is entirely incumbent on the
wife. According to Fraser the fate of the native wife in N.&nbsp;S. Wales is very pitiable.
“Married at an early age, she has not only to bear and rear the children, but she
does all the heavy work of the family; in camp, it is her duty to put up the rude
windshelter of sticks and foliage which serves them as a home, to make a fire and
keep it burning, and to cook the food; on the march, she carries in a bag, resting
on her back and slung from her neck, all their portable property, and seated on this
bag is her youngest child, … in this bag, in addition to the few utensils she requires
for domestic labours, she has a yam-stick with which to dig up the numerous native
roots which are used as food, a supply of these and other articles of food required
for a meal, a quantity of native string and hooks for catching fish.… For the ready
kindling of a fire, whenever it is required, she has to carry with her a smouldering
piece of firewood; if she allows this to go out, and thus puts her lord and master
to the labour of getting fire by friction, or if she in any other way gives him displeasure,
he will beat her severely, <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>even till her body is covered with bruises and her hair is matted with blood”. At
Victoria River Downs Station an old man generally has many wives, “probably to work
and get food for him, for in their wild state the man is too proud to do anything
except carry a <i>woomera</i> and spear.” In Western Victoria “after marriage the women are compelled to do all
the hard work of erecting habitations, collecting fuel and water, carrying burdens,
procuring roots and delicacies of various kinds, making baskets for cooking roots
and other purposes, preparing food, and attending to the children. The only work the
men do, in time of peace, is to hunt for <span class="corr" id="xd32e1348" title="Source: oppossums">opossums</span> and large animals of various kinds, and to make rugs and weapons.” In S.&nbsp;W. Australia
“when, wandering through the woods, the savage observes that the sky threatens rain,
he enjoins his wife to erect a hut at the place which he thinks most fit, and where
he intends to pass the night”. At King George Sound the women look very miserable;
they do all the work. In the Moore River District the wife who has not yams enough
for her husband is severely beaten (as quoted above). The Central Australian wife
is the drudge of her husband. About the natives of Port Darwin we get this information:
“The only reason I know of for the practice of polygamy is that, as the wives have
to provide food for their lords and carry all their family possessions when travelling,
the husband can lead a perfect life of indolence”. Tasmanian women had to procure
all sorts of food, except the kangaroo. Ling Roth quotes a description of a Tasmanian
repast: “Hitherto we had had but a faint idea of the pains the women take to prepare
the food requisite for the subsistence of their families. They quitted the water only
to bring their husbands the fruits of their labour, and frequently returned almost
directly to their diving, till they had procured a sufficient meal for their families”.
Curr, surveying the mode of life of the Australians in general, remarks: “Wives have
to undergo all the drudgery of the camp and the march, have the poorest food and the
hardest work”. Brough Smyth enumerates as duties of the wife “building a new camp,
getting firewood etc. and on journeys acting as a carrier for all the worldly goods
of her husband. They are packed on her back, all excepting his war implements, which
he himself deigns to carry”.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>This picture, surely, is very black. But, unlike Letourneau, we must not view the
dark side only. We may remark, first that, as it appears from the foregoing survey,
there are with regard to each of the Australian tribes but a part of the enumerated
phenomena on record; the black picture is produced by blending the dark sides of each
into a whole. And, secondly, the same writers relate some particulars, which prove
that the life of the Australian wife is not all darkness. These too we shall arrange
in the order observed above.
</p>
<p>A. In some cases we are told, that <i>the girl’s wishes</i> are to some extent <i>taken into consideration</i> as to the choice of her husband. On Herbert River the woman sometimes gets the man
she loves; she is then very happy; sometimes she runs away with the beloved man. In
N.&nbsp;W. Queensland, when a young man and a girl are in love with each other, and the
camp-council is not opposed to it, they elope, live as husband and wife for some two
months, and then return to the camp. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales a girl, to escape from the betrothed
man (oftentimes an old one), may elope with her young lover; she is then brought back
and beaten by her family, “but it may be that she elopes again and again, and, if
at last they see that she is determined on it, they let her have her own way”. In
Tasmania the woman was stolen from her tribe, but not against her will. Most often
the girl succeeded in getting from her father the man she wanted; otherwise she had
to run away with him. Curr remarks: “In no instance, unless Mr. Howitt’s account of
the Kurnai be correct, which I doubt, has the female any voice in the selection of
her husband.” This may be true, if we take “voice” in the sense of a legally recognized
right; virtually, however, she sometimes has a “voice”, as appears from the instances
given here. Howitt’s account which Curr alludes to we have not been fortunate enough
to meet with. According to Brough Smyth “a young man who has engaged the affections
of a girl of a neighbouring tribe, agrees with her to run away at the first opportunity
that offers”. They are then persecuted by the members of her tribe, as custom and
law require, but not energetically. After a few days the young man and his wife return
to his tribe. Except at first some scolding and muttering his new state <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>provokes little comment. “His young wife is treated well, and is soon familiar with
all the women of the tribe, to which she has become attached”.
</p>
<p>B. a, b. Sometimes the ethnographers tell of much <i>affection</i> existing between husband and wife. At Moreton Bay there is often a great affection.
On Herbert River “as a rule man and wife apparently get on very well”. According to
Eylmann, happy unions are not unknown among the natives of South Australia. Fraser
remarks about the aborigines of N.&nbsp;S. Wales: “the <i>kuri</i> or black man is usually kind and affectionate to his <i>jiu</i>, wife”; “in spite of the hardness of their mode of life, married couples often live
happily and affectionately together to a considerable age”. On the river Darling,
N.&nbsp;S. Wales, according to Bonney, “although young women are often compelled to marry
a man of whom they know little and often nothing, they generally find happiness and
contentment in their married lives. Quarrels between husband and wife are rare, and
they show much affection for each other in their own way”. In Central Australia “the
women are not treated usually with anything like excessive harshness”. “Taking everything
into account … the life of one of these savage women, judged from the point of view
of her requirements, in order to make life more or less comfortable, is far from being
the miserable one that it is so often pictured”. Dawson, after describing the work
imposed on women in W. Victoria (as quoted above), adds: “But notwithstanding this
drudgery and the apparent hard usage to which the women are subjected, there is no
want of affection amongst the members of a family”. Even Salvado, who so pities the
S.&nbsp;W. Australian wife, remarks: “Sometimes I heard a betrothed man say: I love her
and she loves me”. Of the Tasmanians we are told that they “treat their women kindly”.
Brough Smyth makes this general statement: “It is hard to believe that even in a lower
state the male would not have had the same feeling of affection for his mate and an
equal jealousy of love as we see among the aborigines now”. In the same sense Bonwick
remarks on the Australian natives in general: “Home life there was not quite the dark
scene some pictured.… Affection is witnessed between <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>husband and wife, parent and child, tribesman and mate”.
</p>
<p>We may add, that the Tasmanian women, though overburdened with work, are described
as a merry and laughter-loving kind of people. And Curr remarks about Australian women
in general: “In every way the female’s looks to us a hard lot; and yet, notwithstanding,
I do not hesitate to say that they are, on the whole, fairly happy, merry and contented.”
</p>
<p>c. <i>The husband does not always enjoy such an entire freedom of action towards his wife.</i>
</p>
<p>Sometimes, for punishing and divorcing her, <i>he must have the consent of the tribe</i>. So in N.&nbsp;S. Wales, in case of adultery “he may complain to the elders of the tribe,
and they, on cause shown, decree a divorce; but not if she has children.” According
to another writer “the husband who suspects another of seducing his wife, either kills
one or both. The affair is taken up by the tribe, if the party belongs to another,
who inflict punishment on him.” In W. Victoria “a man can divorce his wife for serious
misconduct, and can even put her to death; but in every case the charge against her
must be laid before the chiefs of his own and his wife’s tribes, and their consent
to her punishment obtained. If the wife has children, however, she cannot be divorced”.
Here we find also some slight traces of protection of the wife by her relatives: “A
man is allowed to marry his brother’s widow, or his own deceased wife’s sister, or
a woman of her tribe; but he is not permitted to do so, if he has divorced or killed
his wife”. In N.&nbsp;W. Central Queensland the wife is avenged by her relations. “In the
case of a man killing his own <i>gin</i> [wife], he has to deliver up one of his own sisters for his late wife’s friends to
put to death, he personally escaping punishment.… A wife has always her “brothers”
to look after her interests”. At the initiation-feasts “each woman can exercise the
right of punishing any man who may have ill-treated, abused or “hammered” her … the
delinquent not being allowed to retaliate in any way whatsoever”. If these women are
slaves, they at least have their <i>saturnalia</i><a class="noteRef" id="n19.1src" href="#n19.1">22</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>We even find cases of <i>the wife putting a check upon her husband</i>, especially in a sexual respect. On Herbert River the wife is furious if her husband
is unfaithful to her. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales “a wife may similarly complain to them [the elders
of the tribe] of the conduct of her husband, and they may order both the man and his
paramour to be punished”. In W. Victoria “if a husband is unfaithful, his wife cannot
divorce him. She may make a complaint to the chief, who can punish the man by sending
him away from his tribe for two or three moons; and the guilty woman is very severely
punished by her relatives”. “A chief who has been married under the law of betrothal,
is not permitted to marry another woman for a long time; and should he do so without
obtaining the consent of his wife, there would be constant quarreling”. At Port Lincoln
an old, former wife sometimes forces her husband to desist from taking a young, new
one.
</p>
<p>Finally we meet with instances of <i>the wife having a real ascendency over her husband</i>. On Herbert River the husband is sometimes led by his wife, and even beaten by her.
A curious piece of information we get about W. Victoria. When a wife treats her husband
with such persistent disrespect or unkindness as to make him wish to get rid of her,
he goes away to some neighbouring tribe and tries to bring about her death by means
of sorcery. The wife, being informed of this, repairs thither and entreats him to
return, and so a reconciliation is effected.
</p>
<p>In Tasmania the husband could divorce his wife; but she could also force him to do
so.
</p>
<p>d. <i>Exchange of wives</i> does not seem always to take place against their will. In W. Victoria wives may be
exchanged only after the death of their parents and with the consent of the chiefs,
but not if one of them has children. After the exchange both couples live peacefully
together in one hut, each in a separate compartment. If a man knows that his wife
is in love with another, and he is not opposed to it, she can be amicably transferred
to the other man with the consent of the chief. At Port Lincoln the men frequently
exchange wives; brothers and near relatives have their wives nearly in common. The
wife calls the brothers of her husband by the name <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>of husbands. This seems rather a kind of group-marriage than a bartering of wives
as of commodities.
</p>
<p>These two instances point to the possibility that in other cases too exchange of wives
may be not so arbitrary an action as at first sight it seems.
</p>
<p>As to the <i>lending of wives</i>, in some cases it appears that these offer themselves to strangers. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales
the husband “is quite ready to bargain with a white man, and with her consent too;
for a black woman considers it an honour to be thus courted by a man of a superior
race”. The Cammarray women prostitute themselves to Europeans for almost nothing,
and among themselves without any shame. In Central Australia marriage does not impose
any obligation of chastity; the wives always prostitute themselves. In S. Australia
women give themselves to strangers with or without the consent of their husbands.
On Moore River the wives often have connections with young men; the husbands do not
seem to take much notice of it. Moreover, Spencer and Gillen warn us, that “in many
cases in which apparently women are lent (in the sense in which we use the word, which
is the sense in which it is generally used in this connection) indiscriminately, a
knowledge of details would show that this was not so.… In the nine tribes examined
by us we have found that intercourse of this nature is strictly regulated by custom”.
</p>
<p>e. The <i>levirate law</i> sometimes appears in the character of a duty rather than a right of the deceased
man’s brother. Fraser (describing N.&nbsp;S. Wales) calls it a “refuge” for the widow.
Dawson, speaking of the aborigines of W. Victoria, states: “When a married man dies,
his brother is bound to marry the widow if she has a family, as it is his duty to
protect her and rear his brother’s children”. Salvado speaks of the philanthropy of
the S.&nbsp;W. Australian, who takes upon himself the care of the wife of an absent friend
or parent, or of a brother’s widow.
</p>
<p>C. Among the Kurnai <i>the man must hunt</i> for the sustenance of his wife and children, and fight for their protection. In Central
Australia the women “have, as amongst other savage tribes, to do a considerable part,
but by no means all, of the work of the camp, but, after all, in a good season this
does <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>not amount to very much, and in a bad season men and women suffer alike, and of what
food there is they get their share”. The last-cited cases of levirate law, too, show
that the subsistence of the family does not depend on the wife only. Even the instances
quoted under C (p. 15) provide us with evidence that the men perform some kind of
work as hunting the larger animals, making weapons and fishing-nets, getting fire
by friction, etc. And what is said here about the Kurnai certainly applies to all
these tribes: the husband fights to protect his wife. This being his great and indispensable
function, we must not wonder at his not liking to do other work that women can perform
as well<a class="noteRef" id="n22.1src" href="#n22.1">23</a>.
</p>
<p>The division of labour between the sexes is not always so unreasonable as at first
sight it seems. Hore, speaking of the African Wajiji, very justly remarks: “Much has
been said about the unfair division of labour in such circumstances, but when it is
considered that a wild man finds scarcely anything to his hand, but must himself cut
the wood and the grass to build his house, manufacture his spear and cooking vessels,
take his part in tribal duties, and is frequently compelled to seek food in long and
laborious hunting expeditions, it will be seen that he often gets his fair share of
work”<a class="noteRef" id="n22.2src" href="#n22.2">24</a>. A similar division of labour is admirably described by Pinart, as existing among
the Indians of Panama: “I may be allowed to make here a short digression on woman’s
place in the Indian household. <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>It is commonly said by those who have not lived intimately with the Indians, that
they consider woman as a beast of burden, that to her share falls a life full of troublesome
and fatiguing work, and to the man’s an easy and idle existence. It may, indeed, seem
strange to the superficial observer to see the woman charged with heavy burdens and
the man walking before her carrying nothing but his weapons. But if the observer will
only reflect a little, he will understand that, whereas the man carries his weapons
only, the responsibility and the safety of his wife and children are incumbent on
him. The Indian’s life is indeed surrounded with dangers; when traversing a savannah,
or forest, a hostile Indian may appear at any moment; a tiger, a snake etc. may throw
himself upon the travellers. Therefore it is the man’s task to be continually on the
alert, to have his hands and his movements free, in order to be able immediately to
take his arms and defend those who are dear to him. How often have not I seen the
Indian, when about to traverse a river, making his family stand still, entering into
the water and reconnoitring whether it was not too deep or the stream too rapid; then
inspecting the opposite bank to see whether all was right there; then crossing the
river again, helping his wife and children to pass through, often even carrying the
burdens, and several times re-crossing the river to transport on his back his wife
and children. The river being crossed, the man again takes the lead with his arms,
the wife and family resume their burdens, and the little caravan continues its way
in the same order”<a class="noteRef" id="n23.1src" href="#n23.1">25</a>.
</p>
<p>Another fact, proving that the Australian women are not in every respect regarded
as slaves, is the great influence they often have in intertribal matters. “The peace-making
influence of the women is very great, and has often been observed among many tribes”.
“The peace-making function of the women is also very characteristically shown by their
being employed as international ambassadresses”<a class="noteRef" id="n23.2src" href="#n23.2">26</a>. Darwin justly remarks: <span class="corr" id="xd32e1447" title="Not in source">“</span>We thus see that with savages the women are not in quite so abject a state in relation
to marriage, as has often been supposed”<a class="noteRef" id="n23.3src" href="#n23.3">27</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>The question to be settled now is this: Are these Australian wives, and accordingly
all the wives that live in an abject state, to be called slaves? Remembering the conclusion
we arrived at in the third paragraph, we may put the question thus: are they objects
of possession? Under B, a, we have quoted several statements of ethnographers calling
them the slaves, or the property, of their husbands. We must not, however, forget
Ingram’s warning against taking a rhetorical use of the word “slave” too literally.
The facts recorded under B, c, B, d, and C are of more interest to us. The husband
may do with his wife as he likes: ill-use and kill her, overtax her with work, exchange
and lend her. It is but seldom that her relations protect her; in but very few cases
is the man’s power interfered with by the chief or elders of the tribe. Therefore
we cannot but admit that she is the property of her husband.
</p>
<p>Yet there is a reason, why we are not to bring these wives under the denomination
of slaves. We may refer here to the point of view we have taken in determining the
nature of slavery. Slavery is an organ in the social body, that in a peculiar manner
brings about a division of labour. The Australian wives share the character of this
organ as an object of possession. Yet they are not the same organ; for besides being
forced labourers they are wives; hence it follows that their relation towards their
husbands is wholly bound up with the sexual and family life: it is their character
as women, not as labourers, that prevails. We may remember here the mutual affection
observed in so many cases by the ethnographers. As the mother of his children, too,
the husband is likely to value his wife. We have seen (under B, c) that in a few cases
she cannot be divorced or exchanged if she has children. Besides, it is frequently
stated, that the Australian aborigines are very fond of their children<a class="noteRef" id="n24.1src" href="#n24.1">28</a>.
</p>
<p>The Australian woman discharges the duties of a wife and a mother, and besides, to
some extent, the work that among other peoples falls to the share of the slave; therefore
she is not a slave. If she were, her place, in a slave-keeping society, <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>would be entirely occupied by the slave; but no one will doubt whether in any such
society there are wives. In an evolutionary sense the slave and the Australian wife
differ in this: the Australian wife is a not-yet-differentiated organ, performing
two functions, which at a later stage of development will be incumbent on two quite
distinct organs: the peculiar function of a wife, and the labour of a slave. This
reasoning is not an assertion <i>a priori</i>, by a biological parallelism, of a development that must actually have taken place;
it is only intended to show the fundamental difference existing between wives, however
abject their condition, and slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n25.1src" href="#n25.1">29</a>.
</p>
<p>We may even go farther and say: <i>Slavery proper does not exist, when there are none but female slaves.</i> For when females only are enslaved, the reason probably is, that they are valued
as women, not only as labourers; otherwise males would be enslaved too. So, according
to Meyer<a class="noteRef" id="n25.2src" href="#n25.2">30</a>, in the early stages of ancient history, most of the slaves were women and their
chief function was a sexual one. And even where such women are not, all of them, actually
treated as wives or concubines, but only kept as labourers, there is no slavery in
the true sense of the word. In such cases, the husband keeps his wife or wives subjected;
this leads to the keeping of numerous subjected females, who are scarcely to be called
wives. But it is always women, as the weaker sex, who are subjected to the men; subjection
of labourers, only in their quality of labourers, does not exist. The labourers have
the name, if not the state, of wives; this proves that the subjection of labourers
as such, <i>i.e.</i> slavery, is not yet developed.
</p>
<p>We have dwelt at considerable length on this distinction between slaves and subjected
wives. There are some more distinctions to be made between slavery and kindred phenomena;
but these will not occupy so much space and time.

<h3 class="main"><i>II. Children subjected to the head of the family.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a time, the time of the good old patriarchal theory, when the condition
of children in the early stages of social life was thought to be one of complete subjection
to the head of the family, the <i lang="la">pater familias</i>, who had over them an unlimited power, extending to the power of life and death.
Carey, among others, holds this view, and very plainly expresses it. “By nothing is
the progress of mankind in population and wealth made more manifest than by the change
in the relation of parent and child. In the infancy of cultivation the one is a tyrant
and the other a slave”<a class="noteRef" id="n26.1src" href="#n26.1">31</a>.
</p>
<p>The adherents of the matriarchal theory have assigned to the Roman-like agnatic family
its place as a later product of history; but to the question as to how children were
treated in an ante-patriarchal state of culture they have not given much attention.
</p>
<p>It is to Professor S.&nbsp;R. Steinmetz that we are indebted for the first exact inquiry
into the early history of the treatment of children. His conclusions, based upon a
large amount of ethnographical materials, are these:
</p>
<p>With most savages rational education is out of the question, the children soon growing
independent, and when young being either neglected or much petted and spoiled<a class="noteRef" id="n26.2src" href="#n26.2">32</a>; a lesser number of savage tribes show some slight beginnings of education without
or nearly without bodily castigation; in a few cases the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1518" title="Source: childeren">children</span> are under strict discipline. In this last set of cases there is to some extent a
subjection of the children. “With the power over the mother the father gradually acquired
the power over the children.” “The patriarch became master of his children and, whenever
circumstances required and allowed it, introduced a strict discipline over them”<a class="noteRef" id="n26.3src" href="#n26.3">33</a>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>We may therefore suppose, that there will be instances of children being treated in
a somewhat slave-like manner. We shall presently see that there are a few such cases
on record in Steinmetz’s book.
</p>
<p>Among the Apaches the father holds unlimited sway over his children up to the age
of puberty<a class="noteRef" id="n27.1src" href="#n27.1">34</a>.
</p>
<p>Tlinkit boys must render unbounded obedience to their parents and especially to their
maternal uncle, to whom, according to the law of inheritance, they are almost more
nearly related than to their own father. They have to perform the labour imposed upon
them, without any claim to compensation<a class="noteRef" id="n27.2src" href="#n27.2">35</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Botocudos we are told, that the father, being stronger than his children, compels
them to work for him<a class="noteRef" id="n27.3src" href="#n27.3">36</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Aeneze Bedouins the young girls work hard; they drive the cattle to the
pasture-ground; if one out of the herd is lost, they are severely beaten by their
father<a class="noteRef" id="n27.4src" href="#n27.4">37</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Assja Samoyedes the father has a patriarchal power, and punishes at his
discretion and according to custom<a class="noteRef" id="n27.5src" href="#n27.5">38</a>.
</p>
<p>In these few cases only is it clearly stated that the head of the family has an arbitrary
power. The value of Zu Wied’s statement about the Botocudos is much lessened by the
same ethnographer telling us that the children enjoy much freedom<a class="noteRef" id="n27.6src" href="#n27.6">39</a>.
</p>
<p>Considering now the state of the children in the cases referred to here, are we justified
in calling it slavery?
</p>
<p>The head of the family has power over the children; and so far as it appears from
the particulars given by the ethnographers, this is a legally unlimited power, that
may be called right of property, and is likely to lead to compulsory labour, as among
the Tlinkits and Aeneze Bedouins it certainly does. The condition of these children
may therefore be expressed by the word “possession”, our criterion of slavery.
</p>
<p>We may even go farther. The condition of slaves is not always very bad; but however
kindly treated, they are slaves, are the property of their masters. So with children
too. They may not be, as in the cases mentioned above, under strict discipline; yet
the father’s, or in a few cases the maternal <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>uncle’s, power, however moderate a use he makes of it, may be legally unbounded, not
restricted by social rules, not interfered with by the community. In such a case the
head of the family may be called owner of the child, and is really called so in Roman
law, so clearly distinct from Roman practice. “The <i lang="la">patria potestas</i> of ancient civil law means the full power of the father over the persons subjected
to him (the child, the grand-child by the son, the wife <i lang="la">in manu</i>), the right of death and life (<i lang="la">ius vitae ac necis</i>) and the right to sell into slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n28.1src" href="#n28.1">40</a>. “This <i lang="la">potestas</i> originally was equal to that over the slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n28.2src" href="#n28.2">41</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that the term “possession” may well be used here. Yet there is a reason that
induces us not to call these children slaves, a reason resembling that for which we
have excluded the subjected wives. These children may be called the property of their
fathers; but this is not the whole, nor even the main part of their condition. The
relation between father and child, if it includes subjection, includes much more.
There is mutual sympathy and in many respects a coincidence of interests; there is
respect on the side of the child; there is on the side of the father a desire to promote
the welfare of the child, however much bound up with egotistical motives. There is
also physical and mental superiority on the side of the father and inferiority on
the side of the child<a class="noteRef" id="n28.3src" href="#n28.3">42</a>; and this in some cases may bring about a somewhat slave-like condition of the latter;
but this condition is not an essential part of the relation between father and child;
<i lang="la">a fortiori</i> it is not coextensive with the relation, as in the case of the slave. Biologically
expressed: the child is quite another organ, with quite another function, but in some
cases performing in some degree <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>the function of a slave; therefore it is not a slave. We may add, that the child is
only temporarily subjected; one day he will be a master himself<a class="noteRef" id="n29.1src" href="#n29.1">43</a>. This also bears upon the treatment of the child: the slave is brought up to servility,
the child to authority. Children can never form a subjected class.
</p>
<p>As for adopted children, it is not always easy to distinguish them from slaves. Sometimes
they are rather severely treated, especially those captured in war or kidnapped. Tanner
was thus adopted by an Indian of the Shahnee tribe. The youngest son of this Indian
had lately died, and his wife had told her husband, she could not live if he did not
restore her the child. The husband accordingly went off, and came back with Tanner
whom he had kidnapped. Tanner was adopted on the grave of the deceased boy, and given
an Indian name. But the adoptive father treated him not at all as a son. He had to
do the hardest work, got but little food, and was often severely beaten. If the mother
tried to protect him, she was beaten too. Finally the father, regardless of the mother’s
wishes sold him to an old Indian woman, who now became his adoptive mother. She treated
him kindly, yet made him cut wood, carry water and meat, and perform other kinds of
labour, which generally were not imposed upon children of his age. However, he was
not a slave. When full-grown, he was considered by the Indians one of their tribe,
and married an Indian girl<a class="noteRef" id="n29.2src" href="#n29.2">44</a>.
</p>
<p>In the second Chapter we shall meet with more instances of captives being adopted
either into the tribe or into one of the families within the tribe. As long as such
persons are children, it is often not easy to see whether they are slaves or adopted
children, for it is not always stated, as in Tanner’s case, that they are formally
adopted. We must ask then, what becomes of them when full-grown. If they have still
a master to serve, it is clear that they are slaves; for if they are adopted members
of the community, they will be free when adult, excepting the (most often slight)
moral obligations of full-grown children towards their parents. Other facts proving
that the captives are slaves, are their not taking share in government <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>affairs, when the tribe is democratically organized, and their being excluded from
marriage with native-born women. With the aid of these criteria we shall try, in every
particular case, to decide whether the captives are slaves or adopted members of the
community. What has been said here of captives, equally applies to purchased persons.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The last two paragraphs show that there is still something wanting in our definition.
Not every state of possession is slavery; those arising from family relations are
to be excluded. Thus only can we come to a true understanding of the signification
of slavery. For wives and children may accidentally be forced labourers and the like;
the slave only is <i lang="la">ex definitione</i> a subjected person, a forced labourer, an object of possession. Wives and children
there would be, and there are in many cases, without subjection; slaves there are
not where there is not subjection and compulsory labour. A society that begins to
keeps slaves, develops a new organ with a special, well marked function; and it is
the evolution of this organ we are to trace in the following Chapters.
</p>
<p>Our definition therefore wants an addition. We may now put it so: <i>Slavery is the fact, that one man is the property or possession of another beyond
the limits of the family proper.</i>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bastian, after remarking that in a social community nobody is literally free, gives
a great number of quotations, describing widely different kinds of subjection, and
among these some few, where the subjects of a despot are called his slaves or his
property. “The Siamese are all (even marked) slaves of their king.” “The subjects
of the king of Djagga are slaves, who may not marry without his consent.” “In Usumbara
all are slaves of the king.” “The absolute rulers dispose of all their subjects as
their property (even without having acquired a right by the subjects having transgressed
the law), and even <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>mark with their badge the different working-guilds, as is done by the king of Siam.”
“The princes and princesses on the Congo have the right to sell any one who is not
a prince like themselves”<a class="noteRef" id="n31.1src" href="#n31.1">45</a>.
</p>
<p>What Bastian means by heaping up these various quotations, without any order or attempt
at an explanation, is not clear. We, however, must not follow his example, but inquire
whether the word “slave” is rightly used here, whether the subjects of a despot may
be called slaves. A few moments of consideration will show that they may not. For
however great the power of the chief, the king, the despot, in a word the head of
the community, over his subjects, they are not his property. “Property” supposes a
power of the master, pervading the whole life, personal, domestic and social, of the
slave; so great a power over his subjects a chief never has. The following reasoning
will make this clear. Slavery would not be capable of much development, if it depended
upon the master’s personal superiority only; for slavery to become a social system,
the master’s power over the slave must be recognized by the society. The slave lives
in a society that regards him as a slave; slavery cannot exist where there is not
a society of freemen. Therefore the despot, however great his power, is not as such
a master of slaves. The slave-owner has the community on his side; the chief has subjects
who themselves compose the community. Looked at from the practical side, the chief’s
power contains much more of voluntary submission than the slave-owner’s. A chief never
has the whole person of the citizens subjected in his own behalf; he may exact some
performances for his personal benefit, but the restrictions put upon the subjects,
encroaching on their freedom in private life, will generally be measures taken in
the (real or supposed) interest of the community, and approved of by the community.
These restrictions are mutual, and arise from the social connection itself; this is
not, as in slavery, using one person as a means to the purposes of another definite
person. This yet more distinctly appears, where not a single man imposes these rules,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>but the council of citizens. In a communistic society there would be an entire absence
of personal freedom; yet there would be no slaves, as there would be no freemen whom
they could serve.
</p>
<p>It need hardly be said, that a chief may keep slaves like any other freeman. The public
power as such, the state, also sometimes keeps slaves (<i>e.g.</i> the <i lang="la">servi publici</i> in Rome). But these slaves are quite distinct from the main body of citizens.
</p>
<p>Sometimes it is stated, that the chief, or the public power, has slaves, whereas no
mention is made of any other slaves. In such cases the slaves generally become such
as a punishment for some offence. Where such a state of things exists, we may not
speak of a slave-keeping people. For here the power of the government is so great,
that it can avail itself of the labour of the citizens; whether this is done by imposing
an equal amount of labour on all of them, or by selecting a few persons for this purpose
and keeping them in a slave-like state, does not make much difference. Besides, slavery
here cannot have the same influence on social life it generally has; for every freeman
has to work for himself. This kind of slavery may be compared with the tread-mill
and other kinds of penal servitude existing in more civilized societies. And we may
not speak of a slave-keeping people, where the only slaves are criminals, who become
the slaves of him who represents the public power, any more than we can say that slavery
exists in those civilized countries, where penal servitude is still practised.
</p>
<p>One more remark has to be added here. Hitherto we have used the terms “possession”
and “property” synonymously as indicating the nature of slavery. In this paragraph
it has been shown, that an essential feature of slavery is its being recognized by
the community. Therefore we prefer the term “property”, that, better than the other
term, conveys the notion, not only of a virtual subjection, but of a subjection considered
legal in those communities where it exists.

<p class="first"><i>IV. Subjected tribes; tributary provinces; lower classes; free labourers.</i>
</p>
<p>We shall meet with instances of tribes, the members of which are bound to perform
some kind of labour for other tribes or for the members of the latter.
</p>
<p>This is not slavery; for slavery is subjection of one individual to another, and a
subjection that absorbs the whole personality of the subjected; and under such circumstances
it is not possible that the subjected lead a tribal life. Therefore, where the subjected
are described as forming a separate tribe, we may be sure that they are not slaves.
Ingram justly remarks that “the lowest caste may be a degraded and despised one, but
its members are not in a state of slavery; they are in collective, not individual,
subjection to the members of the higher classes”<a class="noteRef" id="n33.1src" href="#n33.1">46</a>. What Ingram says here of the lowest caste, often applies to subjected tribes.
</p>
<p>That conquered districts, bound to pay a tribute in kind or money, do not consist
of slaves, is clear.
</p>
<p>The foregoing remarks would be almost superfluous, were it not that some ethnographers
in such cases spoke of “slave tribes” and “slave districts”. This may partly be caused
by the natives themselves making an incorrect use of the term “slavery”. In North
Africa the coast tribes call the inland tribes their slaves, because they keep them
bound by a trade monopoly. In the same regions a chief calls himself the slave of
another chief, to whom he has to pay a tribute<a class="noteRef" id="n33.2src" href="#n33.2">47</a>. As in some cases the slaves live together in separate villages<a class="noteRef" id="n33.3src" href="#n33.3">48</a>, it may be difficult to decide whether we have to deal with slave villages or with
subjected groups. The criterion then is, whether the subjected people have each an
individual master. When we are informed that such is the case, or that they are bought
and sold, we may be certain that they are slaves.
</p>
<p>Lower classes can be of different kinds. Where they are <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>only considered inferior to the upper classes, or excluded from governmental functions,
it is easy to see that they are not slaves. Greater difficulties are presented by
some other cases. Sometimes a lower class consists of free labourers. Now theoretically
free labourers are easy to distinguish from slaves: the slave is compelled to work,
the free labourer voluntarily submits to it. But the accounts of the ethnographers
do not always make it clear, which of these two kinds of labourers we have to deal
with in any particular case. When a labourer lives in the house of his master and
is wholly dependent on him, it may be rather difficult at first sight to decide whether
he is free or a slave. Sometimes the details given are sufficient to settle the question;
if not, we shall have to leave it undecided.
</p>
<p>A lower class can also consist of serfs. What they are, and what is the difference
between them and slaves, will be shown in the next paragraph.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>V. Serfs.</i>
</p>
<p>What we have said of free labourers applies also to serfs: to draw the theoretical
line of demarcation between them and slaves is not so very difficult; but practically
it is not always easy to decide, whether a subjected class we get some information
about consists of slaves or of serfs; sometimes even, because of the unstable terminology
and the scanty information, it is quite impossible. But there are several unequivocal
cases of serfdom, too, on record in history. Mentioning a few of these will suffice
to give the reader a clear idea of its nature as distinct from slavery.
</p>
<p>In Germany <i lang="de">Leibeigene</i> was, in the earliest times, synonymous with slave. The law placed the <i lang="de">Leibeigenen</i> on a level with the domestic animals. The master had the <i lang="la">ius vitae ac necis</i>, an unlimited right to sell them, the right to exact from them all possible services,
to marry and divorce them. The owner of the <i lang="de">Leibeigene</i> was also owner of his goods and chattels. The lord was responsible for any damages
caused by his servant, as for those caused by his horse, and might claim indemnity
<span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>if any one injured his man. But gradually this slavery was mitigated into a state
of subserviency. First the claim to unlimited services was waived, and on the <i lang="de">Leibeigene</i> were imposed definite <i lang="de">Roboten</i> (labour dues) and tributes. He had to work on fixed days, to perform fixed services,
to pay fixed sums. His earnings legally still belonged to the lord, and the latter
succeeded to his goods; but from the 13<sup>th</sup> century the lord’s right of inheritance dwindled into a present (<i lang="la">mortuarium</i>). From the 14<sup>th</sup> century the serfs acquired a usufruct of the soil they tilled, and so their obligations
assumed more or less the character of a quit-rent. Sometimes they were even allowed
to choose another lord. In the Frankish empire the lords were already forbidden to
sell them abroad; from the 13<sup>th</sup> century they lost the right to kill them, and afterwards also the right to whip them.
The church took away from the lord the right to divorce his serfs, if the marriage
had been contracted with his consent. The <i lang="la">ius primae noctis</i> remained longer. Moreover, the relations of the serfs towards others were gradually
recognized by law, at first only as to unjust acts, later on as to contracts. And
so, when at last serfdom was abolished, the only changes effected by this were: allowing
of the right of emigrating, abolition of the marriage-consent and of the court-services
and personal tributes.
</p>
<p>Thus Siegel describes the development of serfdom in Germany<a class="noteRef" id="n35.1src" href="#n35.1">49</a>. Other writers come to nearly the same conclusions. According to Brunner, there was
among the Western Germans a class between freemen and slaves, called <i>Liten</i> or <i>Aldien</i>, a hereditary class, whose position was secured by law. They had the right of acquiring
property and making contracts; they could by emancipation become fully free, or purchase
their own liberty. To marry they wanted the consent of their lord. They had the right
of feud (<i lang="de">Fehderecht</i>), and when they were killed a <i>wergild</i> was paid, that fell partly to the lord. Their right of inheritance was originally
not recognized<a class="noteRef" id="n35.2src" href="#n35.2">50</a>.
</p>
<p>Schröder remarks, that the difference between freemen and subservients (<i lang="de">Hörigen</i>) consisted in this, that the landed possessions <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>of the latter were smaller and liable to tribute. Moreover, they had no <i lang="la">connubium</i> with freemen, nor any political rights; the <i>wergild</i> paid for them was one half of that paid for a freeman<a class="noteRef" id="n36.1src" href="#n36.1">51</a>.
</p>
<p>In medieval France a similar state of things prevailed. There were no longer slaves,
but serfs. “Serfdom is a transitory stage between slavery and entire liberty. The
serf of the middle ages is not, like the ancient slave, indissolubly riveted to his
condition, deprived of rights by his very birth, placed on a level with the beasts
of burden of his lord’s estate. Public opinion is favourable to him.” “The facts agree
with the doctrine. The serf has some means of acquiring property; he may marry and
have legitimate descendants, who will succeed to his goods; he may give evidence in
the courts; he may purchase his liberty by means of his <i lang="la">peculium</i>. By getting some profits he is interested in the cultivation of the soil. Giving
his labour to the land, he may expect to enjoy the fruits of it, by paying fixed tributes.
By marrying his children to free women he secures the liberty of his offspring. By
paying an indemnity he acquires the succession to his father’s inheritance, and the
right of property over his savings.… He may dispute the tributes (<i lang="la">tallies et cens</i>) which the lord levies on the tenement he cultivates, invoke an enquiry of experts
who attest his means, contract to pay a fixed annuity and so know beforehand what
profit he may depend upon”<a class="noteRef" id="n36.2src" href="#n36.2">52</a>.
</p>
<p>With these serfs may be compared the Roman <i lang="la">coloni</i>. “The <i lang="la">colonatus</i> consists in this, that men are inseparably attached to a landed property for the
purpose of cultivating it.… This connection with a determinate estate, from which
the <i lang="la">colonus</i> might be severed only in some cases fixed by law, brought about an approximation
of the <i lang="la">colonus</i> to the slave (as <i lang="la">servus terrae</i>), but also a difference between them, a security for the <i lang="la">colonus</i>, which protects him from the lord’s arbitrary power. Hence the <i lang="la">colonus</i> stands with regard to the lord on the free footing of one bound only to comply with
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>yearly canon, <i lang="la">annua functio</i>, a tribute fixed by contract or custom, <span class="corr" id="xd32e1829" title="Source: wich">which</span> he has to pay to the lord, generally in products of the land”<a class="noteRef" id="n37.1src" href="#n37.1">53</a>.
</p>
<p>The foregoing statements once more prove the sufficiency of our definition of slavery.
As soon as the forced labourer is no longer entirely at the disposal of the lord,
the latter being entitled to fixed services and tributes only, such a state of things
is called serfdom, or <i lang="la">colonatus</i>, or subserviency, but not slavery. This agrees with our definition of slavery. The
slave, as we have remarked above, is the property of his master, whose power is in
principle unlimited, not restricted to fixed performances. Therefore, even if the
writers referred to here called such institutions as serfdom and <i lang="la">colonatus</i> slavery, we are not to do so; but we may regard it as a corroboration of the conclusion
we had arrived at before, that such writers, most of whom have not made any special
research into the nature of slavery, when they meet with such an institution as serfdom,
feel that they are not to call it slavery.
</p>
<p>Now let us look what the theorists have to say on the subject.
</p>
<p>Ingram remarks: “The transition to serfdom took place in civic communities, when the
master parted with or was deprived of his property in the person of the slave, and
became entitled only to his services, or a determinate portion of them. In rural life,
where the march of development was slower, the corresponding stage was reached when,
in accordance with the fundamental principles of feudalism, the relation between the
lord and serf, from being personal, became territorial”<a class="noteRef" id="n37.2src" href="#n37.2">54</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>The first words here perfectly express the truth: when the master loses “his property
in the person of the slave”, he is no longer a slave-owner. What follows, that the
master “became entitled only to his services”, is less correct; for he who is entitled
to all the services of another is his owner; just the limiting of the master’s right
to “a determinate portion of them” is the change from slavery to something else. If
I may require all the services a man can perform, I am his owner; if I am restricted
to a determinate portion of them, I am not.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Spencer says: “As the distinctions between different forms of slavery are indefinite,
so must there be an indefinite distinction between slavery and serfdom, and between
the several forms of serfdom. Much confusion has arisen in describing these respective
institutions, and for the sufficient reason that the institutions themselves are confused”<a class="noteRef" id="n38.1src" href="#n38.1">55</a>.
</p>
<p>This consideration, however true, will not prevent us from drawing a theoretical line
of demarcation. Not a single social institution is practically strictly separated
from kindred institutions; yet we cannot understand such institutions, unless we make
a distinction, and not an “indefinite” one.
</p>
<p>Letourneau, after describing the state of the <i lang="la">colonus</i>, adds: “In a word, he was not an object of possession, a slave, but only a proletarian
attached to the soil.” In another passage he remarks that slavery always undergoes
some mitigation in the course of civilization: “Less and less is the person of the
slave himself oppressed; one is contented with exploiting him, depriving him in a
larger or smaller degree of the fruits of his labour, in a word the slave becomes
a serf”<a class="noteRef" id="n38.2src" href="#n38.2">56</a>.
</p>
<p>These quotations may suffice to show that our view of the matter is held by theorists
as well as historians.
</p>
<p>The serf, therefore, is not a slave, because he is not the property of his master,
and the particulars of serfdom related by historians provide us with means of more
clearly understanding the practical meaning of this notion “property”. It means a
power that, however leniently exercised in many cases, is in principle unlimited.
Among many peoples the master may ill-use and even kill his slave, without the law
taking any notice of it. And even where his power is restricted by social regulations,
he may have a right of property, viz. if his authority be in principle unbounded,
and any limitation put upon it suppose a special legal provision. The slave-owner
may do with his slave whatever he is not by special laws forbidden to do; the master
of a serf may require from his man such services and tributes only, as the law <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>allows him to require. The slave-owner has a right of property; the master of a serf
has, so to speak, a <i lang="la">ius in re aliena</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n39.1src" href="#n39.1">57</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 9.</span> <i>Pawns or debtor-slaves.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the course of our investigation it will be shown, that among some peoples a debtor,
unable to pay a debt he has contracted, becomes the slave of his creditor. Sometimes
such persons are ordinary slaves; but pawns or debtor-slaves in the restricted sense
(who are of frequent occurrence in the Malay Archipelago, Dutch <i lang="nl">pandelingen</i>) are a class whose slave-state is conditional; they become free as soon as the debt
is paid by or for them; the creditor cannot refuse to accept the money. Because of
this great difference between pawns and ordinary slaves (who generally have not a
right to be ransomed), most ethnographers do not call the former slaves, but give
separate descriptions of slavery and pawning.
</p>
<p>The question arises, and has to be settled here, whether we for our purpose have to
call these pawns slaves. We shall quote here one description of pawning. Among the
Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa “a pawn is a person placed
in temporary bondage to another by the head of the family … either to pay a debt,
or to obtain a loan.… When a person is pawned on account of a debt, the services <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>of the pawn, even should they extend over a considerable number of years, count for
nothing towards the liquidation of the debt; and a pawn has to serve his master, until
the amount of the original debt with 50 per cent. interest, is paid by the person
who pawned him”<a class="noteRef" id="n40.1src" href="#n40.1">58</a>.
</p>
<p>Here the debtor pawns one of the members of his family; among some other peoples (<i>e.g.</i> in the Malay Archipelago) he pawns himself; this is not essential. The main fact
is that the pawn is in “bondage”, however temporarily, that he “has to serve his master.”
Therefore, as long as the debt remains unpaid, the pawn is in the same condition as
a slave. He has not to perform a fixed amount of labour, he must serve his master
without any limitation; the master has over him a power that is, in principle, unlimited.
Now we have to inquire: Is this pawn a slave, <i>i.e.</i> is he the property of his master? In a legal sense the creditor has not a right of
property over his pawn; his right agrees with a kind of <i>pignus</i> which the Romans called <i lang="la">antichresis</i>, <i>i.e.</i> something yielding profit was handed over to the creditor, who utilized it instead
of receiving the usual interest<a class="noteRef" id="n40.2src" href="#n40.2">59</a>. Yet the right of the holder of the pawn bore much resemblance to that of the owner:
he had a <i lang="la">utilis in rem actio</i>, a <i lang="la">vindicatio pignoris</i><a class="noteRef" id="n40.3src" href="#n40.3">60</a>. We, for our purpose, may classify the pawns among the slaves, if we can prove that
sociologically a system of pawning performs the same function as a slave-system. And
this certainly is the case. The same system of compulsory labour, the same subjection
of the entire person exists, whether the subjected are perpetually slaves or temporarily
pawns, viz. in those cases where, as among the Tshi-speaking peoples, the master’s
power is in principle unlimited. Where pawns have a fixed amount of work to do, they
are temporary serfs; but where (as is most often the case) no limit is put to the
amount of work the master may exact from them, they are temporary slaves, and as long
as they are slaves, take the same place as other slaves in the social system.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n39.1src">57</a></span> Mr. Westermarck observes: “According to a common definition of slavery, the slave
is the property of his master, but this definition is hardly accurate. It is true
that even in the case of inanimate property the notion of ownership does not involve
that the owner of a thing is always entitled to do with it whatever he likes; a person
may own a thing and yet been prohibited by law from destroying it. But it seems that
the owner’s right over his property, even when not absolute, is at all events exclusive,
that is, that nobody but the owner has a right to the disposal of it. Now the master’s
right of disposing of his slave is not necessarily exclusive; custom or law may grant
the latter a certain amount of liberty, and in such a case his condition differs essentially
from that of a piece of property. The chief characteristic of slavery is the compulsory
nature of the slave’s relation to his master” (Moral Ideas, I pp. 670, 671).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">We are fully aware that a certain amount of liberty is often granted to the slaves.
This was also the case in ancient Rome; yet we think the Roman legislators were correct
in calling the slaves the property of their masters. For every check, put by custom
or law upon the master’s power over his slaves, is foreign to the nature of slavery;
in principle the master’s power is unlimited, just as the owner’s power over his property.
It is just in this that slavery differs from other relations of a compulsory nature.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n39.1src" title="Return to note 57 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="first">Having now determined what is the meaning of the term “slavery”, we are about to inquire,
what is its social signification, what place does it occupy in those societies where
it formerly existed or still exists? As this book confines itself to ethnological
investigations, we shall try to throw light on this problem with the help of the data
supplied to us by the study of savage races. But then we must first know, whether
slavery exists among all savage tribes, and, if not, whether it is confined to certain
races of men or to certain parts of the world; and further, whether it is found on
all levels of lower culture, or on some only, and if the latter, on which. The solution
of these problems requires a survey of the occurrence of slavery among wild tribes
in the several parts of the globe. This survey will occupy the present chapter.
</p>
<p>A few words have still to be said about our method of ascertaining the existence or
non-existence of slavery in every particular case.
</p>
<p>To one unacquainted with our science the task to be performed now may seem very easy:
we have only to consult the ethnographical literature bearing on any tribe, and to
look whether slavery is mentioned; if it is mentioned in an affirmative sense, slavery
exists; if in a negative sense or not at all, slavery does not exist. But every one
familiar with ethnographical literature knows that it has not to be used in such a
rough-and-ready manner. The statements of ethnographers <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>are not to be accepted without much caution and a thorough criticism<a class="noteRef" id="n42.1src" href="#n42.1">1</a>.
</p>
<p>The observance of the following rules will, so far as we can judge, give to our conclusions
the highest possible degree of probability.
</p>
<p>1º. If it is stated that slavery exists, is this sufficient evidence of its existence?
Our definition, arrived at in the first chapter, lies within the limits of ordinary
language; therefore it is probable that our informants have used the term in the same
sense we attach to it. There are, however, many cases in which the words “slave” and
“slavery” are applied to something quite different from their true meaning, as will
be seen from our survey of the matter. Thus it is necessary to ask for more evidence
than is given by the mere term “slavery”.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> If it sufficiently appears that in some tribe there are men considered to be the
property of others, we need not doubt whether slavery exists.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> If this is not clearly proved, there is still one particular, that being mentioned
makes the existence of slavery very probable, viz. the fact that people are bought
and sold within the tribe, except of course women sold for wives. For other kinds
of subjected persons, serfs, lower classes, and subjects of a despot, are not bought
or sold, at least not within the tribe. Beyond the limits of the tribe a man may be
sold without previously having been a slave. Thus some African despots sell their
subjects to Arabian slave-traders; such a sale does not prove that slavery exists
within the tribe. But when a man is sold within the tribe, either he was already a
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>slave, or he becomes such, <i>e.g.</i> as a punishment; in both cases slavery is practised by the tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n43.1src" href="#n43.1">2</a>.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> If the particulars on record are quite insufficient to determine the nature of the
alleged slave-state, the possibility of a mistake is much lessened by several writers,
independently of each other, stating that slavery exists.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Finally, the general trustworthiness of the writer or writers must be taken into
account.
</p>
<p>2º. If we are told that there are no slaves, it is very probable that slavery really
does not exist, for slavery is a phenomenon rather easy to observe, and the ethnographers
are generally inclined to use the word in a too wide rather than in a too restricted
sense. There is no need here for the extreme scepticism with which we have to receive
an assertion of any tribe having no religion<a class="noteRef" id="n43.2src" href="#n43.2">3</a>. This does not prevent, of course, that if we find the existence of slavery denied
by a writer who is generally badly informed, we may reject such an assertion.
</p>
<p>3º. The greatest difficulties are presented by those cases in which no mention is
made of slavery. Here the utmost caution has to be observed.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> If it clearly appears from the description, that there are people considered to be
the property of others, without the word “slavery” being used, the conclusion is evident.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Perhaps some facts are mentioned which make the existence of slavery highly improbable.
We shall see that the main source of slavery is captivity in war; so, if it is stated
that no captives are made, or that the lot of the captives is something else than
slavery, the non-existence of slavery is probable. But even then it is not quite certain:
there may still be slaves, acquired by other means. Further: if it is stated that
there are no social classes, or if the classes are enumerated and slaves are not among
them, there is a strong presumption that slavery does not exist. Yet here too there
is no certainty; for slaves, among savage tribes, have not always the aspect of a
social class. The description of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>division of labour between the sexes may also suggest to us the non-existence of slavery.
When we are informed that the men do some kinds of work and the women some other kinds,
we are inclined to think: if there were slaves, their special work would be mentioned
too. But this argument is most dangerous; for the slaves very often have no special
kind of work allotted to them.
</p>
<p>We see that none of these criteria prove quite reliable. Yet, taken together, they
give a high degree of probability. And it is not even necessary that all of them can
be ascertained. If an ethnographer, <span class="corr" id="xd32e1988" title="Source: know">known</span> to be trustworthy, gives us an elaborate description, pretending to be a picture
of the whole social life of the tribe he describes, it were a wonder if he had entirely
omitted slavery, while it existed; the more so as this phenomenon is not so difficult
to recognize. The same argument obtains <i lang="la">a fortiori</i>, when several such descriptions of the same tribe exist.
</p>
<p>4º. In doubtful cases we may take into account the state of the group to which a particular
tribe belongs. It may be that in the general descriptions of a group no mention is
made of slavery; that, further, all tribes belonging to this group of which we are
well informed prove to have no slaves. If, then, the information we get concerning
a particular tribe belonging to the same group, is not complete enough to rely upon,
there is a strong presumption that this tribe will be in the same state as the rest
of the group, <i>i.e.</i> that it does not keep slaves. Under the same conditions we may suppose that a tribe
belonging to a slave-keeping group keeps slaves. The term “group” has to be taken
here in a sociological, not in an anthropological or linguistic sense, and its application
must be somewhat restricted. It must consist of tribes, that live in somewhat similar
conditions and the institutions of which closely resemble each other; <i>e.g.</i> Australia (the continent) is a group in this sense, North America is not. It is almost
superfluous to add, that this group-argument may be used only to strengthen existing,
but insufficient, evidence.
</p>
<p>We confine ourselves here to the phenomena of savage life; therefore we shall exclude
the semi-civilized peoples. An exact distinction, however, between these two classes
of peoples has <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>not yet been made<a class="noteRef" id="n45.1src" href="#n45.1">4</a>; so we are fully aware of the possibility of mistakes, made here in this respect.
As we were not able to apply any exact criterion, we have more or less followed our
general impressions, paying most attention to the development of political institutions.
So for instance we have excluded the Kabyls of Northern Africa, because their detailed
legal system, as described by Hanoteau and Letourneux<a class="noteRef" id="n45.2src" href="#n45.2">5</a>, proves that politically they have passed beyond the stage of savagery. And a developed
political organization cannot exist without profoundly marking such an institution
as slavery.
</p>
<p>We shall find that several savage tribes have to a considerable extent been influenced
by civilized or semi-civilized nations. In such cases the question arises: have we
to deal here with phenomena of unadulterated savage life? This question is important
and deserves full attention. We shall see that many savage tribes in their true aboriginal
state have been acquainted with slavery, whereas many others when first discovered
did not practise it; so neither the existence nor the non-existence of slavery must
necessarily be due to foreign interference; either may be aboriginal, and must be
supposed to be so wherever there is not a strong presumption to the contrary<a class="noteRef" id="n45.3src" href="#n45.3">6</a>. But there are also many cases in which foreign influence has undoubtedly been at
work. We must, then, make a distinction. If the influence of the civilized or semi-civilized
nation has led to a, so to speak, normal development, <i>i.e.</i> a development, which lies within the limits of primitive culture, we have to deal
with a phenomenon of savage life. For instance, commercial intercourse with a nation
of higher civilization has brought about an accumulation of wealth and a social differentiation,
which render the existence of slavery possible. In such case we may safely speak of
slavery as practised by savages, for it is the effect of trade in general, not of
intercourse with a <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>civilized nation as such, that we have to deal with here. If, on the contrary, there
has been an abnormal development, <i>i.e.</i> a development which does not take place in countries inhabited by savages only, the
present condition of the savage tribe has no interest to us. For instance, measures
have been taken by a civilized nation on purpose to abolish slavery. Then we, for
our purpose, must consider the savage tribe concerned as keeping slaves, and pay attention
only to the descriptions of its institutions as they were before the abolition.
</p>
<p>The ensuing paragraphs will show which savage tribes keep slaves and which do not
keep any. The groups into which we have divided the several tribes are mainly geographical,
not intended to answer any anthropological purpose. As long as the meaning of the
term “race” is so unstable as at present, we think it better not to operate with it.
Our groups are nearly the same as those given by Schurtz in his <i lang="de">Völkerkunde</i>.
</p>
<p>At the end of each paragraph its result will be mentioned. The “positive cases” are
the tribes which probably keep slaves, the “negative cases” those which probably do
not keep slaves. Under the head of “no conclusion” we have given the cases in which
the probability that slavery exists is nearly as great, or as little, as the inverse
probability. The tribes, the names of which are printed in italics, are those which
afford “clear cases”, <i>i.e.</i> where the probability nearly amounts to certainty.
</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter a brief recapitulation will show the occurrence of slavery
among savages in the several parts of the globe.
</p>
<p>When, in the following paragraphs, we say: “Such a tribe keeps slaves,” or: “Such
a tribe does not keep slaves,” this does not imply that the same state of things still
prevails. The tribe we speak of may have died out; or, where slavery existed, it may
have been abolished. When we know that such a thing has taken place, we shall use
the past tense. But in many cases the only information we have got concerning some
tribe dates from many years back; and we do not know what has become of this tribe
in the meantime. Then, not to be obliged always to use such tedious formulas as: “In
Mr. X.’s time slavery existed among such a tribe,” we shall simply say: “slavery exists.”
Whether it still exists is certainly of <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>much interest to a philanthropist; but to us, for the purposes we have set ourselves
in the present volume, it is quite immaterial.

<p class="first">Rink’s account applies especially to Western Greenland at the time of the first European
settlement, but may be taken as a general description of the Eskimos<a class="noteRef" id="n47.1src" href="#n47.1">7</a>. According to him the family in the restricted sense comprehended foster-children,
widows, helpless persons adopted as relatives and more or less treated as servants.
They were regarded as subordinate members of the family but never subjected to any
corporal punishment<a class="noteRef" id="n47.2src" href="#n47.2">8</a>. He then describes their social organization, but makes no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n47.3src" href="#n47.3">9</a>. The question remains whether these helpless persons are to be called slaves. This
does not very clearly appear; but, happily, we have more detailed accounts of the
several Eskimo tribes.
</p>
<p>Crantz, in his description of the Greenlanders, gives many particulars about their
servants. Mothers of illegitimate children are despised; sometimes a childless person
buys her children. When a married couple have no children or no full-grown children,
the husband adopts one or two orphan boys, who help him in his work and must provide
the family with the <span class="corr" id="xd32e2065" title="Source: neccessaries">necessaries</span> of life. The same is done by the wife with daughters of others or with a widow. Although
the adopted youths are employed as servants, they are free from any compulsion, and
are regarded as the future lords of the house. The adopted maid-servant or daughter
can leave when she likes. A man will never beat his man-servant, and were he to touch
a maid-servant, he would incur great disgrace<a class="noteRef" id="n47.4src" href="#n47.4">10</a>. We see that the condition of these servants is not slavery. The boy is the future
lord of the house, the girl may leave when she pleases. Servants are only required
to occupy the place that in a normal household is taken up by the children. <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>Labour is not asked for. “If a man dies without leaving behind relatives, or full-grown
sons, nobody cares for the children, unless one wants a maid-servant.” A widow must
try to get a lodging, in which she does not always succeed<a class="noteRef" id="n48.1src" href="#n48.1">11</a>. It is clear that to these Greenlanders slaves would not be of any use. Nansen, too,
makes no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n48.2src" href="#n48.2">12</a>.
</p>
<p>Boas, describing the Central Eskimos, states that among them too children are adopted
and regarded by the adoptive parents as their own children; so “an elder adopted son
has a preference over a younger son born of the marriage,” viz. as to the right of
inheritance. The following statement still more directly bears on our subject: “Sometimes
men are adopted who may almost be considered servants. Particularly bachelors without
any relations, cripples who are not able to provide for themselves, or men who have
lost their sledges and dogs are found in this position. They fulfil minor occupations,
mend the hunting-implements, fit out the sledges, feed the dogs, etc.; sometimes however,
they join the hunters. They follow the master of the house when he removes from one
place to another, make journeys in order to do his commissions, and so on. The position,
however, is a voluntary one, and therefore these men are not less esteemed than the
self-dependent providers”<a class="noteRef" id="n48.3src" href="#n48.3">13</a>. The last sentence clearly shows that these servants are not slaves. And as in no
other place does Boas make any mention of slaves, it is certain that slavery does
not exist.
</p>
<p>Ribbach gives some notes on the Eskimos of Labrador. There is nothing on slavery in
these notes. Describing their dwellings he says: “The principal family has of course
the best place; the servants, widows or orphans, if there are such, have to content
themselves with a place near the door, where the cold is most severe”<a class="noteRef" id="n48.4src" href="#n48.4">14</a>. This agrees so much with the foregoing descriptions, that we may suppose that the
same state of things prevails here.
</p>
<p>As little mention is made of slavery in the descriptions of some other Central Eskimo
tribes, as the Frobisher Bay and <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>Field Bay Eskimos<a class="noteRef" id="n49.1src" href="#n49.1">15</a>, the Kinipetu Eskimos<a class="noteRef" id="n49.2src" href="#n49.2">16</a>, the Tchiglit Eskimos<a class="noteRef" id="n49.3src" href="#n49.3">17</a>, the Eskimos of the Ungava district<a class="noteRef" id="n49.4src" href="#n49.4">18</a>.
</p>
<p>Bancroft says of the Western Eskimos (or Eskimos of Alaska): “Slavery in any form
is unknown among them”. Elliott makes no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n49.5src" href="#n49.5">19</a>.
</p>
<p>The describers of the Eskimos of Point Barrow, too, have not a word about slavery.
Adoption is practised to a great extent<a class="noteRef" id="n49.6src" href="#n49.6">20</a>. So the same state of things probably prevails here as among the other Eskimos.
</p>
<p>Some other tribes, belonging to the Eskimo group in the wider sense<a class="noteRef" id="n49.7src" href="#n49.7">21</a>, may also be treated here.
</p>
<p>Amongst the Aleuts, according to Bancroft, the chief “is exempt from work, is allowed
a servant to row his boat, but in other respects possesses no power”<a class="noteRef" id="n49.8src" href="#n49.8">22</a>. No more is added bearing on our subject. Petroff, however, gives a detailed account
of slavery among them. The slaves were prisoners of war and their descendants. The
master could punish the slave with death, could sell and liberate him. Any attempt
to escape was severely punished.<a class="noteRef" id="n49.9src" href="#n49.9">23</a>. So the Aleuts had slaves.
</p>
<p>The Athka Aleuts, according to Petroff, had also slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n49.10src" href="#n49.10">24</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Koniagas or Southern Eskimos “slavery” says Bancroft “existed to a limited
extent.” This is affirmed by Holmberg<a class="noteRef" id="n49.11src" href="#n49.11">25</a>.

<p>The same applies to the Haidas<a class="noteRef" id="n49.13src" href="#n49.13">27</a>.
</p>
<p>Krause, in a short note, speaks of a female slave of a Tsimshian chief. Niblack states
that the Tsimshians acted as <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>middlemen in the slave trade. Boas describes the legends of the Tsimshians; in these
legends slaves and their occupations are frequently spoken of. Kane, in his census
of Indian tribes states that among the Tsimshians there were slaves.<a class="noteRef" id="n50.1src" href="#n50.1">28</a>. Hence we may infer that slavery formerly existed among them.
</p>
<p>Boas, speaking of the Kwakiutl Indians, writes: “All the tribes of the Pacific Coast
are divided into a nobility, common people and slaves. The last of these may be left
out of consideration, as they do not form part and parcel of the clan, but are captives
made in war, or purchases, and may change ownership as any other piece of property”<a class="noteRef" id="n50.2src" href="#n50.2">29</a>. From this statement it appears that the Kwakiutl kept slaves.
</p>
<p>Krause says of the Bilballas; “The chief possessed numerous wives and many slaves;
also were these Indians much given to slave-stealing and the slave trade”<a class="noteRef" id="n50.3src" href="#n50.3">30</a>. As the Bilballas are reckoned by Bancroft among the Haidas, amongst whom, according
to him, “slavery is universal”, we may suppose, that slaves were kept by them for
their own use, not for export only.
</p>
<p>The many details, given in the works of Sproat and Brown, prove that slavery existed
among the Ahts of Vancouver Island<a class="noteRef" id="n50.4src" href="#n50.4">31</a>.

<p>The Nootkas, among whom, according to Bancroft, “slavery is practised <span class="corr" id="xd32e2186" title="Source: bij">by</span> all the tribes”, seem to be the same as the Ahts<a class="noteRef" id="n50.5src" href="#n50.5">32</a>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to Kane, who was well acquainted with this group, <span class="corr" id="xd32e2209" title="Not in source">“</span>slavery in its most cruel form exists among the Indians of <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>the whole coast, from California to Behring’s Straits, the stronger tribes making
slaves of all the others they can conquer. In the interior, where there is but little
warfare, slavery does not exist.” Niblack, however, states that slavery existed among
the interior Tinneh but they “had no hereditary slaves, getting their supply from
the coast”<a class="noteRef" id="n51.1src" href="#n51.1">35</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Kutchins or Loucheux Jones says: “Slavery is practised among them. Any poor
creature who has no friends is made a slave”<a class="noteRef" id="n51.2src" href="#n51.2">36</a>. Hardisty gives more details; he tells us: “As a rule slavery does not exist, but
the orphan and the friendless are kept in servitude and treated so harshly as to be
really little better than slaves, until such time as they get big enough and bold
enough to assert their independence, when they are allowed to shift for themselves”<a class="noteRef" id="n51.3src" href="#n51.3">37</a>. Such ill-treated children, who when full-grown are “allowed to shift for themselves”,
certainly are not slaves. Therefore we may safely infer, that slavery did not exist
here, the more so, as the other authors<a class="noteRef" id="n51.4src" href="#n51.4">38</a> make no mention of slaves.
</p>
<p>Mackenzie, describing the Chepewyans or Athabascas, states that “they are constantly
at war with the Eskimos, and kill as many of them as they can, as it is a principle
with them never to make prisoners”<a class="noteRef" id="n51.5src" href="#n51.5">39</a>. Neither in his notes on the Chepewyans in general, nor in those on some single tribes
belonging to the Chepewyan family, as the Slave and Dog-Rib Indians, Hare Indians,
Beaver and Rocky-Mountain Indians, does our informant make any mention of slavery.
Nor is there a word to be found about slaves in Russell’s and Bancroft’s accounts.
Hearne speaks of Northern and Southern Indians, divisions of the Chepewyans. Among
the Southern Indians a wife sometimes begs of her husband, who is going to war, to
bring a female slave with him for her to kill. The chief Matonabbee was the son of
a Northern Indian man and a Southern Indian slave<a class="noteRef" id="n51.6src" href="#n51.6">40</a>. Hearne does not speak of male slaves. So we may suppose that slavery proper does
not exist.
</p>
<p>On the Tacullies Bancroft remarks: “Slavery is common <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>with them, all who can afford it keeping slaves. They use them as beasts of burden,
and treat them most inhumanely”<a class="noteRef" id="n52.1src" href="#n52.1">41</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Atnas on Copper River, a division of the Kenai, Bancroft says: “Those who can
afford it, keep slaves, buying them from the Koltschanes”<a class="noteRef" id="n52.2src" href="#n52.2">42</a>.

<p>Mrs. Allison informs us that among the Similkameem Indians of British Columbia “slaves

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The authors we have consulted on the Algonquins in general<a class="noteRef" id="n52.4src" href="#n52.4">44</a> make no mention whatever of slaves.
</p>
<p>Loskiel, describing the Lenape or Delawares, states that captured boys and girls were
received into their families, and employed as servants; sometimes, however, they were
sold to Europeans. If such prisoners behaved well, they had nothing to complain of
and were not overworked. If they ran away and were recaptured, they were generally
killed. But the adult male prisoners, viz. those of them who were not killed, were
adopted by families, instead of those who had been killed in war or had died in some
other way, and from this moment were looked upon as members of the tribe to which
they now belonged<a class="noteRef" id="n52.5src" href="#n52.5">45</a>. As these men became members of the tribe, it is not probable that the captive children
were made slaves; we may safely suppose that as long as they were young they had to
perform menial work, but when adult were on a level with the members of the tribe.
And as neither Loskiel, in any other passage, nor Brinton refers to slavery, slaves
were very probably not to be found among the Delawares.<a class="noteRef" id="n52.6src" href="#n52.6">46</a>.
</p>
<p>In Le Jeune’s account of the Montagnais no mention is made of slaves. Prisoners of
war were cruelly put to death<a class="noteRef" id="n52.7src" href="#n52.7">47</a>.
</p>
<p>The Ojibways or Chippeways, according to Keating, killed the captive warriors and
old women; the marriageable women <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>became slaves and were very cruelly treated by the women of the victorious tribe;
the children were adopted and treated fairly well<a class="noteRef" id="n53.1src" href="#n53.1">48</a>. Jones’s account is somewhat different. Most often all enemies were killed. Sometimes
they made a few prisoners, who were adopted by those who had lost a relative; then
the adopted prisoner became a relative or slave; if not adopted he was burned alive.
The relatives of a murderer sometimes paid large indemnities to those of the victim;
the murderer had then to work for them in order to pay off the debt; he was reduced
to a kind of servitude<a class="noteRef" id="n53.2src" href="#n53.2">49</a>. In these accounts slaves and servitude are mentioned. The servitude of the murderer
very probably was not slavery. He had to work: but it is not stated that he was made
a slave, <i>i.e.</i> the property of an individual person. The prisoners who became “relatives or slaves”
were adopted; therefore they were not slaves in the proper sense of the word. And
as for the female slaves Keating speaks of, we know that a slave system without male
slaves is not slavery proper. We may suppose, that these female captives became an
inferior kind of wives, to whom the women of the tribe were unkind through a very
natural jealousy. Kohl, in his elaborate description of the Ojibways, makes no mention
of slavery. Their wars, he states, did not bring them any profit<a class="noteRef" id="n53.3src" href="#n53.3">50</a>. According to Carver, “all that are captivated <span class="corr" id="xd32e2291" title="Source: bij">by</span> both parties, are either put to death, adopted, or made slaves of.” “That part of
the prisoners, which are considered as slaves, are generally distributed among the
chiefs, who frequently make presents of some of them to the European governors of
the out-posts, or to the <span class="corr" id="xd32e2294" title="Source: superintendants">superintendents</span> or commissaries of Indian affairs. I have been informed that it was the Jesuits and
French missionaries that first occasioned the introduction of these unhappy captives
into the settlements and who by so doing taught the Indians that they were valuable”<a class="noteRef" id="n53.4src" href="#n53.4">51</a>. From all the foregoing we may infer that slavery was not an indigenous institution
among the Ojibways.
</p>
<p>This inference is strengthened by what Tanner tells us of the Ottawas, an Ojibway
tribe. He was adopted by an Ottawa <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>woman, but was not at first on a level with the other children. The first few years
she made him do various kinds of manual labour: he had to cut wood, fetch water and
do other kinds of work, which were not generally required from children of his age.
Yet when grown-up he was on a level with the Indians into whose tribe he was admitted,
and married an Indian girl<a class="noteRef" id="n54.1src" href="#n54.1">52</a>.
</p>
<p>Before passing to the Ottawas, Tanner had been a captive amongst the Shahnees. He
was very cruelly and ignominiously treated. Yet he was not a slave, for he had been
adopted by a married couple on the grave of their youngest son, whose place he was
to fill<a class="noteRef" id="n54.2src" href="#n54.2">53</a>. As this agrees with the general customs of this group, in which there are no slaves,
we may suppose that here also slavery was unknown.
</p>
<p>The Potawatomi also very probably had no slaves; for none of their describers make
any mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n54.3src" href="#n54.3">54</a>.
</p>
<p>Amongst the Crees or Knisteneaux, according to McLean, adoption of aliens was practised.
A missionary, who had unintentionally killed a Cree boy, offered himself in his stead,
and was adopted. Kane speaks of “the universal custom of Indian mothers eagerly seeking
another child, although it may be of an enemy, to replace one of her own, whom she
may have lost.… This child is always treated with as great, if not greater, kindness
than the rest.” The existence of this custom, together with the fact that none of
their describers makes mention of slaves, renders it most probable that they did not
keep slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n54.4src" href="#n54.4">55</a>.
</p>
<p>The Cheyennes very seldom captured adult males; when they did, they generally put
them to death. Children were adopted and treated like their own children; women became
the wives of their captors<a class="noteRef" id="n54.5src" href="#n54.5">56</a>. Slavery is not mentioned.
</p>
<p>The Blackfeet nation consisted of four tribes: Piegans, Blackfeet, Bloods, and Gros
Ventres. We are told that once when at war against the Crows, the Gros Ventres “rushed
upon them and killed the whole number”<a class="noteRef" id="n54.6src" href="#n54.6">57</a>. Grinnell, speaking of a Piegan <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>chief, says: “He told his men not to kill the captured women. They also captured …
many children. The chief selected a wife for himself from among these women.” As a
rule they spare none of their enemies, killing alike men, women and children. Sometimes
they spare a captive for his bravery or from dread of sorcery; he is then provided
with food and dismissed to his home<a class="noteRef" id="n55.1src" href="#n55.1">58</a>. These particulars being given, and no mention made of slavery by any of our informants<a class="noteRef" id="n55.2src" href="#n55.2">59</a>, we may safely infer that slavery did not exist among these tribes.
</p>
<p>Among the Abenakies, according to Maurault, prisoners of war were either tortured
to death or adopted into the tribe. Hence we may infer that slavery, of which this
writer makes no mention, was unknown among them<a class="noteRef" id="n55.3src" href="#n55.3">60</a>.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd32e2353" title="Source: Hoffmann">Hoffman</span>, in his description of the Menomini Indians, referring to Grignon, says that he does
not know whether they had captive slaves; but certainly they had purchased slaves.
Our informant saw 6 male and 8 female slaves, most of whom had been enslaved when
young. The female slaves had been sold for 100 dollars each. The slaves were called
Pawnees, though some of them belonged to other tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n55.4src" href="#n55.4">61</a>. This statement sufficiently proves, that in the time of this description the Menomini
had slaves. But in <span class="corr" id="xd32e2361" title="Source: Hoffmann’s">Hoffman’s</span> time they were already very much under the influence of European civilization. Whether
at the more remote period from which most of our information on the Algonquin tribes
dates slavery existed among them, we do not know.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">5.</span> Iroquois group.</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Iroquois had no slaves. This is stated by Morgan, who was intimately acquainted
with them. “Slavery”, says Morgan, “which in the Upper Status of barbarism became
the fate of the captive, was unknown among tribes in the Lower Status in the aboriginal
period.” And the Iroquois are his typical instance of this “Lower Status”: “When discovered
the Iroquois <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>were in the Lower Status of barbarism.” Captives were either put to death or adopted<a class="noteRef" id="n56.1src" href="#n56.1">62</a>. Charlevoix states, that “most of their captives are condemned to death, or to a
state of abject slavery in which they were never certain of their lives”<a class="noteRef" id="n56.2src" href="#n56.2">63</a>. But he gives no more particulars about this slave state, nor do our other informants<a class="noteRef" id="n56.3src" href="#n56.3">64</a>. On the contrary, Lafitau informs us, that the condition of prisoners, whose life
is rather hard amongst the Algonquin tribes, amongst the Iroquois and Hurons is very
easy<a class="noteRef" id="n56.4src" href="#n56.4">65</a>. The descriptions given by the authors of the fate of captives justify Morgan’s statement:
they were either killed or adopted<a class="noteRef" id="n56.5src" href="#n56.5">66</a>; and though Lafitau calls the prisoners “<i lang="fr">esclaves</i>”, their state, as he describes it, is not at all like that of slaves. So we may safely
infer, that slavery did not exist among them, and that Charlevoix’s above quoted statement
is erroneous.
</p>
<p>Among the Hurons or Wyandots, according to Powell, the captives were either killed
or adopted<a class="noteRef" id="n56.6src" href="#n56.6">67</a>. Lafitau’s and Charlevoix’s accounts of the fate of captives among the Iroquois apply
also to the Hurons. So it is probable that they had no slaves.

states that they burned their prisoners. Only if a prisoner succeeded in escaping
to the house of the high-priest or some other place of refuge, he was not burned;
but what his fate was in such a case we are not told. Young prisoners were not killed;
but it is not stated what became of them. If warriors had offended a neighbouring
tribe, and the chiefs wished to prevent war, they sacrificed either one of the offenders
belonging to a weak family or some unfortunate prisoner, who had been incorporated
into a declining tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n56.7src" href="#n56.7">68</a>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>The last sentence seems to show, that the custom of adopting prisoners prevailed here
too. At any rate, no mention is made of slaves.

<p>Rochefort remarks that among the Apalaches (who, according to Roosevelt, included
the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks and Seminoles<a class="noteRef" id="n57.1src" href="#n57.1">69</a>) an enemy who surrendered during the fight, was taken to the conqueror’s home with
his wife and children, held in an honourable freedom and treated with as much leniency
and care as their own servants<a class="noteRef" id="n57.2src" href="#n57.2">70</a>. Whether such persons were slaves does not clearly appear from this statement. But
Adair’s record tends to prove that slavery did not exist, at least as far as the three
former divisions of the Apalaches are concerned.
</p>
<p>Loskiel relates that a prisoner was once condemned to death by the Cherokees. He had
already been tied to the stake, when a Cherokee woman arrived. She brought a basketful
of commodities, which she deposed at the feet of the man to whom the prisoner belonged,
and bade him leave this prisoner to her, a childless widow, who wanted to adopt him
as a son. This was done<a class="noteRef" id="n57.3src" href="#n57.3">71</a>.

<p>Bartram tells us that the Creeks formerly tortured their captives to death<a class="noteRef" id="n57.4src" href="#n57.4">72</a>.

<p>The Seminoles, too, according to Roosevelt, used to burn their prisoners<a class="noteRef" id="n57.5src" href="#n57.5">73</a>.

<p>From all the foregoing we may safely infer that slavery did not exist in the Apalache

<p>Strachey describes the inhabitants of Virginia (several tribes). He makes no mention
of slaves. It is stated in his account, that children and foreigners were sacrificed<a class="noteRef" id="n57.8src" href="#n57.8">76</a>; if there had been slaves, these probably would in the first place have been <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>the victims. One of the objects of their wars was to capture women and children. Before
the commencement of the battle it was announced that the conquered “upon their submission
or comyng in, though two daies after, should live, but their wives and childrene should
be prize for the conquerors”<a class="noteRef" id="n58.1src" href="#n58.1">77</a>. Another ancient writer gives a different description of the fate of their conquered
enemies: “when they gain a victory, they spare neither men, nor women, nor children,
in order to render revenge impossible”<a class="noteRef" id="n58.2src" href="#n58.2">78</a>. We cannot arrive at a definite conclusion here.

children were well treated and restored on the conclusion of peace; but often they

</p>
<p>Owen Dorsey informs us that among the Omahas “Slavery was not known”. “Captives were
not slain by the Omahas and Ponkas. When peace was declared, the captives were sent
home, if they wished to go. If not they could remain where they were, and were treated
as if they were members of the tribe; but they were not adopted by any one”<a class="noteRef" id="n58.7src" href="#n58.7">83</a>. This positive statement is not weakened by James’s assertion about captive women

<p>Of the Assiniboins we are told: “Chiefs never receive a gift, considering it a degradation
to accept anything but what their own prowess or superior qualities of manhood acquire
for them. Their hearts are so good and strong that they scorn to take anything, and
self-denial and the power to resist temptation to luxury or easily acquired property
is a boast with them”<a class="noteRef" id="n59.2src" href="#n59.2">86</a>. Where even the chiefs rely only on their own prowess, the existence of slavery is
improbable.
</p>
<p>Lewis and Clark, describing the Mandans, speak of prisoners living among them. One
of their chiefs had been taken prisoner and adopted by them, “and he now enjoys great
consideration among the tribe.” In another place they tell us of a woman, who was
sold as a slave to a Mandan chief, who brought her up and afterwards married her<a class="noteRef" id="n59.3src" href="#n59.3">87</a>. The evidence is not sufficient to decide, whether their prisoners were held as slaves

<p class="first">Gibbs describes the tribes of Western Washington and North-Western Oregon in general.
The principal of these tribes are the Chinooks and the tribes about Puget Sound. “Slavery,”
says Gibbs, “is thoroughly interwoven with the social policy of the Indians of the
coast section of Oregon and Washington Territory. East of the Cascades, though it
exists, it is not so common.… Southward it ceases, so far as my observation has gone,
with the Siskiou Mountains, which divide Oregon from California”<a class="noteRef" id="n59.4src" href="#n59.4">88</a>.
</p>
<p>“By the Flatheads,” says Bancroft, “captives are generally killed by their sufferings.”
McLean, speaking of their wars, remarks: “When one party lost more than the other,
compensation <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>was made in slaves or some other kind of property”<a class="noteRef" id="n60.1src" href="#n60.1">89</a>. This statement does not, however, prove that slavery existed among them; these “slaves”
might be members of the tribe, delivered up either to be killed or adopted. So we
are left in doubt as to the existence of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n60.2src" href="#n60.2">90</a>.
</p>
<p>The Chinooks had slaves. Bancroft says: “Slavery, common to all the coast families,
is also practised by the Chinooks; … the slaves are obliged to perform all the drudgery
for their masters, and their children must remain in their parents’ condition, their
round heads serving as a distinguishing mark from freemen”. Kane also gives many particulars
about their slave system<a class="noteRef" id="n60.3src" href="#n60.3">91</a>. Equally Swan, describing the Chinooks and neighbouring tribes, makes mention of
slavery as practised by them<a class="noteRef" id="n60.4src" href="#n60.4">92</a>. Lewis and Clark speak of a war, in which the Killamucks took several prisoners.
“These, as far as we could perceive, were treated very well, and though nominally
slaves, yet were adopted into the families of their masters, and the young ones placed
on the same footing with the children of the purchaser”. This short note is not sufficient
for us to arrive at any definite conclusion, the less so, as these writers themselves
declare that they had not the opportunity of making a close study of the tribes of
the Pacific Coast<a class="noteRef" id="n60.5src" href="#n60.5">93</a>.

<p>“The Shushwaps,” Bancroft remarks, “are said to have no slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n60.6src" href="#n60.6">94</a>. Among the Okanagans, a division of the Shushwaps, according to Ross, “there are
but few slaves … and these few are adopted as children, and treated in all respects
as members of the family”<a class="noteRef" id="n60.7src" href="#n60.7">95</a>. From this it would seem that slavery proper does not exist.
</p>
<p>Another division of the Shushwaps are the Atnahs on Fraser River (not to be confused
with the Atnas on Copper River). Mackenzie describes a division of Indians, whom he
does not mention under a separate name; but they seem to be akin to the Atnahs. “The
Atnah and Chin tribe,” says Mackenzie, “as <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>far as I can judge from the very little I saw of that people, bear the nearest resemblance
to them.” On these Indians he remarks: “The strangers who live among these people
are kept by them in a state of awe and subjection”<a class="noteRef" id="n61.1src" href="#n61.1">96</a>. These strangers perhaps are slaves; but the lack of further details prevents our
arriving at any positive conclusion.
</p>
<p>Bancroft, after describing the manner in which some tribes put their prisoners to
death, adds: “Among the Sahaptins some survive and are made slaves.… The Nez Percé
system is a little less cruel in order to save the life for future slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n61.2src" href="#n61.2">97</a>. So the Sahaptins or Nez Percés seem to have kept slaves, though we should wish for
some more particulars that would exclude all doubt.
</p>
<p>Powers states, that female slaves are more numerous among the Shastika than among
the Californians<a class="noteRef" id="n61.3src" href="#n61.3">98</a>. This short note is the only evidence we have been able to collect on the subject.
</p>
<p>Kane makes mention of slavery as practised by some other tribes, about which we could
not collect further information (perhaps they are subdivisions of the tribes already
enumerated) viz. the Macaws, Babines or Big-lips, Nasquallies and Kye-uses<a class="noteRef" id="n61.4src" href="#n61.4">99</a>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the Northern Californians Bancroft tells us: “Although I find no description of
an actual system of slavery existing among them, yet there is no doubt that they have
slaves. Illegitimate children are the life-slaves of some male relative of the mother,
and upon them the drudgery falls; they are only allowed to marry one in their own
station, and their sole hope of emancipation lies in a slow accumulation of allicochick
(shell-money), with which they can buy their freedom”<a class="noteRef" id="n61.5src" href="#n61.5">100</a>.
</p>
<p>Powers gives some more particulars about two North Californian tribes. Among the Karoks
it is thought ignominious for a man to have connection with a female slave. When the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>purchase-money for the wife has not been paid, the children are looked upon as bastards;
they live as outcasts and marry none but persons of their own condition. Among the
Hupas a similar system prevails. A bastard is much despised; when old enough he is
taken from his mother and becomes the property of one of her male relatives; he is
not a slave, and yet has no share in the privileges of the family. The produce of
his labour belongs to his master; he may marry only a person of his own condition,
and is treated with ignominy. What he wins by gaming is his own; when this amounts
to 15 or 20 dollars, he is free. His children are of the same rank<a class="noteRef" id="n62.1src" href="#n62.1">101</a>.
</p>
<p>Although these bastards present a close resemblance to slaves, Powers explicitly says
that they are not slaves. Probably they are only a despised class; for social status,
among these tribes, depends largely upon wealth. The chief “obtains his position from
his wealth, and usually manages to transmit his effects, and with them his honours,
to his posterity”<a class="noteRef" id="n62.2src" href="#n62.2">102</a>. “The ruling passion of the savage seems to be love of wealth; having it he is respected,
without it he is despised”<a class="noteRef" id="n62.3src" href="#n62.3">103</a>. We may therefore suppose, that these bastards are despised because penniless, and
as soon as they possess 15 or 20 dollars, respected for their wealth. And as we “find
no description of an actual system of slavery existing among them,” slavery probably
does not exist<a class="noteRef" id="n62.4src" href="#n62.4">104</a>.
</p>
<p>Gatschet, describing the Klamath Indians, makes mention of slaves. Once they attacked
the Pit River Indians, “killed the men, abducted the women and children to their homes,
or sold them into slavery at the international bartering place at The Dalles.” According
to Judge E. Steele “they had been selling to whites and others Indian children of
their own and other tribes, and also squaws, the latter mainly for the purpose of
prostitution”<a class="noteRef" id="n62.5src" href="#n62.5">105</a>. Whether all slaves were sold abroad, or any slaves were kept by them, does not appear.
According to Bancroft “Mr. Drew asserts that the Klamath children of slave <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>parents, who, it may be, prevent the profitable prostitution or sale of the mother,
are killed without compunction”<a class="noteRef" id="n63.1src" href="#n63.1">106</a>. Altogether the notes given by our informants are insufficient for us to decide,
whether slavery really exists here.
</p>
<p>On the Central Californians Bancroft remarks: “Slavery in any form is rare, and hereditary
bondage unknown.” “They do not appear to have kept or sold prisoners as slaves, but
to have either exchanged or killed them”<a class="noteRef" id="n63.2src" href="#n63.2">107</a>. Here “rare” is perhaps a synonym for “absent”; at any rate the existence of slavery
here is doubtful.
</p>
<p>As for the Southern Californians, according to Bancroft, “Hugo Reid affirms of the
natives of Los Angeles County that all prisoners, after being tormented in the most
cruel manner, are invariably put to death.… Female prisoners are either sold or retained
as slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n63.3src" href="#n63.3">108</a>. From Boscana’s narrative also it would appear, that there were formerly slaves among
them. “No quarter” he says “was ever given, and consequently, no prisoners were ever
made among the men, excepting of such as were killed, or mortally wounded. These were
immediately decapitated.… The women and children taken prisoners, were either disposed
of by sale or detained by the captain as slaves.… The women and children were never
released,—ever remaining as slaves to their enemies”<a class="noteRef" id="n63.4src" href="#n63.4">109</a>. But as no more details are added and as Boscana describes a state of things which
in his time had already ceased to exist, we are not quite sure whether slaves were
really kept by these Indians.
</p>
<p>The Nishinam, according to Powers, killed their male prisoners. Women, after being
flogged, were married; but sometimes they were also killed<a class="noteRef" id="n63.5src" href="#n63.5">110</a>. So it seems that they had no slaves.

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">10.</span> New Mexicans.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the Shoshones and Utahs we are not very well informed. “An act which passed the
legislature of Utah in 1852 … <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>set forth that from time immemorial slavery has been a customary traffic among the
Indians.” But we are not told who bought and who sold the slaves. It is only stated
that the Utahs sold their wives and children into slavery to the Navajos<a class="noteRef" id="n64.1src" href="#n64.1">111</a>. It is not probable that the Shoshones and Utahs themselves had slaves; for Bancroft
states that prisoners of war were killed, or in some cases dismissed unhurt, and Meline
tells us, that the Utes and Pueblos almost invariably sold their prisoners to the
Mexicans for slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n64.2src" href="#n64.2">112</a>.
</p>
<p>Bancroft, describing the Apache family (including Apaches, Comanches, Navajos, Mojaves,
etc.), says: “All the natives of this family hold captives as slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n64.3src" href="#n64.3">113</a>. But his account of the Comanches does not quite agree with this general statement:
“Prisoners belong to the captors and the males are usually killed, but women are reserved
and become the wives or servants of their owners, while children of both sexes are
adopted into the tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n64.4src" href="#n64.4">114</a>. According to Schoolcraft, “prisoners of war belong to the captors and may be sold
or released at their will”. Captive children are adopted and afterwards are on a level
with the members of the tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n64.5src" href="#n64.5">115</a>. Gregg speaks of prisoners being enslaved and ill-treated by the conquerors. But
whether he means to say that they remained slaves is not clear<a class="noteRef" id="n64.6src" href="#n64.6">116</a>. Cessac also speaks of slaves. “If, among the captives of the deceased, one was particularly
loved by his master, he is sacrificed and buried with him.” “If a favourite slave
is sacrificed, it is to give the master a fellow-traveller.” No more particulars about
these slaves are given. In their wars against the Mexicans they spare none but the
children, whom they treat as their own. “These captives forget their origin and later
on, when full-grown, become an integral part of the tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n64.7src" href="#n64.7">117</a>. It is not clear whether the slaves Cessac speaks of are identical with these adopted
children; he would not have used then the term “slave” in its proper sense. Ten Kate,
a careful observer, states that a number of Mexican captives, altogether about fifty,
live among the Comanches and Kioways; they have almost entirely adopted <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>the manners and customs of the Indians and are regarded by the latter as members of
their tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n65.1src" href="#n65.1">118</a>. Another author tells us of a Mexican boy and girl, taken prisoners by the Comanches.
The boy was afterwards sold to the Cherokees, the girl was married against her will
by a Comanche. Another captive Mexican woman was married to a Comanche chief<a class="noteRef" id="n65.2src" href="#n65.2">119</a>. Comparing these several statements, we think it probable, though not quite certain,
that the Comanches did not keep slaves, but adopted their prisoners.
</p>
<p>Ten Kate’s above-quoted statement applies also to the Kioways. Möllhausen met with
two young Mexican prisoners among them, a man and a woman. The young man declared,
that he did not want to exchange his present abode for another. The woman, though
married to a chief and mother of a young chief, expressed the wish to return to her
own country; but the chief would not let her and her child go<a class="noteRef" id="n65.3src" href="#n65.3">120</a>. We may suppose, that the same state of things prevailed here as among the Comanches.
</p>
<p>Of the Apaches proper Bancroft (besides his above-quoted general statement) says:
“They treat their prisoners cruelly; scalping them, or burning them at the stake;
yet, ruled as they are by greediness, they are always ready to exchange them for horses,
blankets, beads, or other property. When hotly pursued, they murder their male prisoners,
preserving only the females and children, and the captured cattle”<a class="noteRef" id="n65.4src" href="#n65.4">121</a>. This is not very suggestive of slavery; and Bancroft’s general statement about the
Apache family appears rather strange. Schoolcraft tells us: “These [the chiefs] can
have any number of wives they choose; but one only is the favourite. She is admitted
to his confidence, and superintends his household affairs; all the other wives are
slaves to her; next come his <i>peons</i>, or slaves, and his wife’s slaves, and the servants of his concubines; then the young
men or warriors, most generally composed of the youth who have deserted other tribes
on account of crimes, and have fled to the protection of the chief of this tribe.…
Then come the herdsmen, and so on”<a class="noteRef" id="n65.5src" href="#n65.5">122</a>. These <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>“slaves”, ranking even above the warriors, very probably were not slaves in the true
sense of the word. According to Bourke, the Mexican captives, living among the Apaches,
were treated very kindly and often rose to positions of great influence. It does not
appear that these captives were kept in a slave-like state. Fremont and Emory say:
“Women, when captured, are taken as wives by those who capture them, but they are
treated by the Indian wives of the capturers as slaves”. It is evident that we have
not to do here with slaves in the true sense. Taking into consideration all the foregoing
statements, we may suppose that slavery did not exist among the Apaches<a class="noteRef" id="n66.1src" href="#n66.1">123</a>.
</p>
<p>In an above-quoted passage Bancroft states that the Utahs frequently sell their wives
and children as slaves to the Navajos. According to Bent, the Navajos, “have in their
possession many prisoners, men, women and children, … whom they hold and treat as
slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n66.2src" href="#n66.2">124</a>. But these statements are not sufficient for us to go upon; these prisoners may be
adopted, or <span class="corr" id="xd32e2714" title="Source: indended">intended</span> to be sold, as well as kept as slaves.
</p>
<p>Miss Olive Oatman, who had been detained among the Mohaves or Mojaves, says: “They
invented modes and seemed to create necessities of labour that they might gratify
themselves by taxing us to the utmost, and even took unwarranted delight in whipping
us on beyond our strength. And all their requests and exactions were couched in the
most insulting and taunting language and manner, as it then seemed, and as they had
the frankness soon to confess, to fume their hate against the race to whom we belonged.
Often under the frown and lash were we compelled to labour for whole days upon an
allowance amply sufficient to starve a common dandy civilized idler”<a class="noteRef" id="n66.3src" href="#n66.3">125</a>. Though such prisoners are held in a slave-like state, yet evidently the object of
the masters in imposing disagreeable work upon them is not to get useful labourers,
but to “fume their hate”. This account may warn us against attaching too much value
to statements about slavery among similar tribes, especially where the “slaves” are
whites. For such tribes as the Apaches, who are always ready to exchange their prisoners
for some <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>property, will be very apt to take prisoners, especially whites, who are likely to
offer a better ransom than Indians. In such cases the prisoners are not killed; for
by killing them the Indians would lose their ransom; but they may safely, as in Miss
Oatman’s case, be treated as slaves by way of vengeance. But where these are the only
slaves existing, a regular slave-system does not prevail. As for the Mohaves, no more
particulars being given, we do not know whether they have slaves.
</p>
<p>In Bancroft’s account of the Pueblo tribes no mention is made of slavery. On the Pimas
he informs us: “If prisoners are taken, the males are crucified or otherwise cruelly
put to death, and the women and children sold as soon as possible”<a class="noteRef" id="n67.1src" href="#n67.1">126</a>.
</p>
<p>In Parker Winship’s article it is quoted from Mendoza’s letter, that the Cibola Pueblo
“keep those whom they capture in war as slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n67.2src" href="#n67.2">127</a>. This being the only reference made to slavery, we are unable to decide whether it
really existed.
</p>
<p>Ten Kate in his detailed account of the Zuñi (a Pueblo tribe) makes no mention of
slavery; so they probably have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n67.3src" href="#n67.3">128</a>.
</p>
<p>Bancroft, describing the Lower Californians, has nothing about slavery. Although their
battles are described at some length, no mention is made of captives; probably they
took no prisoners<a class="noteRef" id="n67.4src" href="#n67.4">129</a>. We may therefore safely infer, that slavery did not exist among them.

<p>We may add here a short account of Negro-slavery among the Indians.
</p>
<p>According to the census of 1860, several Indian tribes had Negro-slaves. Our informant
enumerates the Choctaws, Cherokees, Creeks and Chickasaws. Slavery was carried on
to a great extent; some owners had from 50 <span class="corr" id="xd32e3222" title="Source: tot">to</span> 200 slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n69.1src" href="#n69.1">131</a>. We may remember that all these tribes originally had no slaves.
</p>
<p>The Creeks already in Bartram’s time (1789) had slaves. <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>He tells us of a chief who kept 15 Negroes; they were slaves until they married Indian
women, and then acquired the privileges of the tribe. Schoolcraft informs us that
“if an Indian should murder a Negro, the law is satisfied with the value of the Negro
being paid to the owner”<a class="noteRef" id="n70.1src" href="#n70.1">132</a>.
</p>
<p>The Seminoles also had Negro-slaves, according to Roosevelt and Gregg<a class="noteRef" id="n70.2src" href="#n70.2">133</a>. But Maccauley is not quite certain about it. He observed a few Negroes living with
them. It had been said that they were slaves; but our informant is not of that opinion<a class="noteRef" id="n70.3src" href="#n70.3">134</a>. Maccauley’s account, however, dates from a later period than the other statements.
</p>
<p>The Shahnees in Gregg’s time also kept a few Negro slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n70.4src" href="#n70.4">135</a>.
</p>
<p>But these facts do not represent phenomena of unadulterated savage life. These Indian
tribes had already undergone great changes by contact with the whites. Moreover, the
Negroes kept by them as slaves were in a very peculiar condition, living in a foreign
continent amongst foreign races. So we are justified in omitting these cases from
our list of slave-keeping Indian tribes.

<p class="first">About the treatment of prisoners by the wild tribes of North Mexico Bancroft remarks:
“Seldom is sex or age spared, and when prisoners are taken, they are handed over to
the women for torture, who treat them most inhumanly, heaping upon them every insult
devisable, besides searing their flesh with burning brands, and finally burning them
at the stake, or sacrificing them in some equally cruel manner. Many cook and eat
the flesh of their captives, reserving the bones as trophies”<a class="noteRef" id="n70.5src" href="#n70.5">136</a>. These particulars given, and no mention being made of slaves, slavery probably does
not exist among them.
</p>
<p>Among the wild tribes of Central Mexico “the heads of the slain were placed on poles
and paraded through their villages in token of victory, the inhabitants meanwhile
dancing round them. Young children were sometimes spared, and reared to <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>fight in the ranks of their conquerors, and in order to brutalize their youthful minds
and eradicate all feelings of affection toward their own kindred, the youthful captives
were given to drink the brains and blood of their murdered parents”<a class="noteRef" id="n71.1src" href="#n71.1">137</a>. Whether these children became slaves is not quite clear; we should think not, as
they were “reared to fight in the ranks of their conquerors”; but this may also be
the case with slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n71.2src" href="#n71.2">138</a>. The lack of further particulars prevents our arriving at a positive conclusion.
</p>
<p>Bancroft’s notes on the wild tribes of South Mexico are very scanty. They sacrificed
their prisoners. The Mayas had female slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n71.3src" href="#n71.3">139</a>.
</p>
<p>Bancroft informs us that “one principal object of war among the ancient nations of
Honduras was to make slaves; but the Mosquito Coast was free from this scourge, according
to all accounts.” “When prisoners were taken they were usually held as slaves, after
having the nose cut off.… The coast people … usually kill their prisoners.” Wickham,
who gives a detailed account of the Woolwa or Soumoo of the Mosquito Coast, makes
no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n71.4src" href="#n71.4">140</a>. So the inhabitants of Honduras had slaves, whereas those of the Mosquito Coast had
not.
</p>
<p>Slavery, according to Bancroft, was in force among the inhabitants of the Isthmus
of Panama and Costa Rica, with the exception of the Caribs. “The prisoner is the slave
of the captor; he is branded on the face and one of his front teeth knocked out. The
Caribs however used to kill and eat their prisoners”. Gabb, who gives several particulars
about the tribes of Costa Rica, makes no mention of slavery. According to Pokalowsky,
the Indians of Coctu in Costa Rica, when conquered by the Spaniards in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, had slaves. “They cut off the heads of their prisoners and preserve them
as trophies; the boys and girls of the enemies are enslaved or sacrificed to their
gods. If a master dies, his slaves are killed and buried with him; this custom prevails
here to a greater extent than in any other part of India”<a class="noteRef" id="n71.5src" href="#n71.5">141</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bancroft’s statement about the Caribs of the Isthmus is confirmed by the fact that
Pinart, who has largely drawn upon ancient Spanish literature, makes no mention of
slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n72.1src" href="#n72.1">142</a>.
</p>
<p>Rochefort speaks of slavery existing among the Caribs of the Antilles. They believed,
that the bravest warriors of their nation after death would live in happy islands,
and have their enemies, the Arawaks, for slaves, whereas the cowards would be the
slaves of the Arawaks. In their wars with the Spaniards they did not kill the Negro
slaves, but took them with them and made them work. Sometimes slaves were killed after
their master’s death, to serve him in the other world. Male prisoners were killed
and eaten after a few days. Captive women became slaves; their children were reared
with those of the Caribs. Female prisoners were sometimes taken for wives; then the
children were free, but the mothers remained slaves. In the isle of Saint Vincent
there were in Rochefort’s time English boys and girls, captured when very young; they
had quite forgotten their parents, and would not even return with them, so accustomed
were they to the mode of life of the Caribs, who treated them very kindly, just as
if they were of their own nation. De la Borde makes no mention of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n72.2src" href="#n72.2">143</a>. It seems to us very doubtful whether slavery really existed here. Rochefort’s statement
that captive children were reared with those of the conquerors is more suggestive
of adoption of captives than of slavery, and the enslavement of Negroes by the Indians
is something foreign to the aboriginal state of things, as has been said before. So
we cannot arrive at a definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>The Continental Caribs, according to Gumilla, killed all their prisoners, except the
young women and children, whom they sold<a class="noteRef" id="n72.3src" href="#n72.3">144</a>. So slavery probably did not exist among them.
</p>
<p>Ling Roth, in his article on Hispaniola or Hayti (inhabited by Arawaks), makes no
mention of slavery; but this does not prove much, as his sources of information (early
Spanish literature) were very incomplete. For instance, he has not been able to find
anything bearing on the division of labour between the sexes<a class="noteRef" id="n72.4src" href="#n72.4">145</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>The several describers of the Indians of Guiana<a class="noteRef" id="n73.1src" href="#n73.1">146</a> make no mention of slavery. The tribes most fully described are the Arawaks, Warraus,
Macusi and Roucouyennes. Martius however states that the Arawaks have slaves, who
work in their houses and on the fields<a class="noteRef" id="n73.2src" href="#n73.2">147</a>. So we are not certain about the Arawaks; but we may safely suppose that among the
three other tribes slavery does not exist.
</p>
<p>The Saliva of Columbia, according to Gumilla, made war in order to acquire slaves
to till their lands<a class="noteRef" id="n73.3src" href="#n73.3">148</a>.
</p>
<p>In Sievers’, Reclus’ and Simons’ descriptions of the Goajiro no mention is made of
slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n73.4src" href="#n73.4">149</a>. According to De Brettes, however, “slavery exists; but the slave is a member of
the family, though looked upon as an inferior being that may be killed if he refuses
to obey”. A few more details are added about these slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n73.5src" href="#n73.5">150</a>. Sievers, reviewing De Brettes’ articles, remarks that this author is generally not
very trustworthy, but that the ethnographical parts are the best of his work. Speaking
of a photograph of Goajiro slaves given by De Brettes, be adds: “If there can be any
question at all of slavery among them”<a class="noteRef" id="n73.6src" href="#n73.6">151</a>. On the same page, however, he translates De Brettes’ ethnographical account of the
Goajiro, in which it is stated that slavery exists, without any commentary. Considering
all this, we cannot arrive at any accurate conclusion.
</p>
<p>De Lery, speaking of the ancient Tupinambas, describes at considerable length the
fate of their captives, who were killed and eaten; even the child of a captive and
a woman of their own tribe was not allowed to live. Though an expert hunter or fisher,
and a woman well able to work, were preserved somewhat longer than the rest, all were
invariably killed after a few months. Nowhere in De Lery’s book does it appear, that
they made slaves by capture or by any other means<a class="noteRef" id="n73.7src" href="#n73.7">152</a>. According to another ancient writer, however, they kept prisoners as slaves. The
slaves were kindly treated, allowed to <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>marry free women, but finally killed and eaten. They had to catch fish and game and
to bring it to their master. Without the master’s consent they were not allowed to
work for others. If they tried to escape and were caught, they were killed. A slave,
who died a natural death, was not buried but thrown away in the bush<a class="noteRef" id="n74.1src" href="#n74.1">153</a>. All this is very suggestive of slavery. But the fact, that D’Evreux got his information
through an interpreter, prevents us from decidedly concluding, against the testimony
of our other informants, that the Tupinambas kept slaves.
</p>
<p>Martius remarks about the Indians of Brazil in general: “Many of these tribes keep
slaves.… Captivity in war is the only cause by which one loses his freedom, especially
if a male; for the husband may sell his wife and children; but this is of rare <span class="corr" id="xd32e3350" title="Source: occurence">occurrence</span>”<a class="noteRef" id="n74.2src" href="#n74.2">154</a>.
</p>
<p>The Apiacas (a group of the Central Tupis), according to the same author, in their
wars kill all adult prisoners, male and female, and eat them. Children they take with
them and rear them with their own; they make them work in the plantations; but when
about twelve or fourteen years old, these children are killed and eaten<a class="noteRef" id="n74.3src" href="#n74.3">155</a>. Though these children may be kept in a somewhat slave-like state, a tribe that kills
its slaves when full-grown is not properly to be called a slave-keeping tribe.
</p>
<p>The same author informs us, that the Mundrucus and Mauhés have slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n74.4src" href="#n74.4">156</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Miranhas we are told that they enslave their prisoners; but usually these prisoners
are intended to be sold to the whites. It does not appear whether any of them are
kept for the Miranhas’ own use<a class="noteRef" id="n74.5src" href="#n74.5">157</a>.
</p>
<p>Keane, von Tschudi and Ehrenreich make no mention of slavery among the Botocudos.
According to Zu Wied “the conqueror persecutes the vanquished, and but seldom makes
captives, at least among the Botocudos; but on the Belmonte there are said to be seen
some who were used as slaves for all kinds of work”<a class="noteRef" id="n74.6src" href="#n74.6">158</a>. We do not know what this last second-hand information of Zu Wied’s is worth; but
we are justified <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>in inferring that the Botocudos in general (except those on Rio Belmonte) have no
slaves.
</p>
<p>Azara states that in his time (he travelled in South America from 1781 to 1801) the
Guaycurû had nearly died out, only one man being left<a class="noteRef" id="n75.1src" href="#n75.1">159</a>. But according to Boggiani Guaycurû is a general name for the tribes that inhabit
the Gran Chaco<a class="noteRef" id="n75.2src" href="#n75.2">160</a>, so this statement of Azara’s seems to apply to a small division of the Guaycurû
only. Southey and Martius give some particulars about the slave system of the Guaycurû<a class="noteRef" id="n75.3src" href="#n75.3">161</a>; but Colini, who has taken great pains to ascertain the identity of these tribes,
quotes these descriptions as referring to the Mbayás. Of the ancient Guaycurû he says:
“In their combats they gave no quarter to the adult males; but they spared the lives
of the youths, whom they educated after their customs and gave in marriage to their
daughters, so as to augment the number of their tribe. Full-grown women were sold
to the neighbouring nations, who made them slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n75.4src" href="#n75.4">162</a>. The only captives whom they kept among them, the youths, were not slaves; so slavery
probably did not exist among them.
</p>
<p>Two tribes inhabiting the Gran Chaco and so belonging to the Guaycurû in Boggiani’s
sense, are described by Thouar. Of the Chiriguanos he says: “The prisoners are the
property of their captors and must serve the mistress of the hut.” In his description
of the Tobas he makes no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n75.5src" href="#n75.5">163</a>. Thouar, however, does not seem to be very well informed<a class="noteRef" id="n75.6src" href="#n75.6">164</a>.
</p>
<p>The Mbayás, according to Azara, in his time had two kinds of slaves, one composed
of the Guanás, the other of Indian and Spanish prisoners of war. But the former were
no real slave class. The Guanás “used to repair in troops to the Mbayás, to obey and
serve them and till their lands without any payment. Hence the Mbayás always call
them their slaves. This slavery is indeed very mild, as the Guaná voluntarily submits
to it, and leaves off whenever he likes.” Such “slaves”, who lead a tribal life and
come and go when they like, certainly are not slaves. The others however were real
slaves. They procured the fuel, cooked the food, took care of the horses <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>and tilled the land. When Azara once offered a present to a Mbayá, the latter would
not take it himself, but ordered his slaves to receive it for him. Even the poorest
Mbayá had three of four slaves. During the mourning-time women and slaves were not
allowed to speak or eat any meat. One place in Azara’s book seems to show that they
had no slaves: “They said they had received a divine command to wage war against all
nations, kill the adult males and adopt the women and children, in order to augment
their number.” But where the recorded tradition and the description of the actual
state of things disagree, we hold that the latter is to be accepted<a class="noteRef" id="n76.1src" href="#n76.1">165</a>. Colini refers to Azara and Martius, and then adds: “Serra however asserts that among
the Mbayás slavery proper (<i lang="it">la schiavitù vera e propria</i>) did not exist; the slaves might rather be called servants.” They fought together
with the freemen and took part in the public council, even when it decided upon war
and peace. They married free persons, but were themselves looked upon as slaves. On
the master’s death, the sons or next relations, according to the rules of inheritance,
became masters of the slaves; but these rights were only nominal. The slaves gradually
merged into the tribe. Yet it was always considered degrading to be a descendant of
a slave; those who had in their ancestry none but members of the tribe were very proud
of it. Generally the best slave girls were married to their masters; the boys of greatest
promise were treated as sons, whereas the others were set to do the ruder work<a class="noteRef" id="n76.2src" href="#n76.2">166</a>. This account, however, does not prove that the captives were not slaves. Some of
the boys only were treated as sons; what were the rest if not slaves? And even slaves
may to a certain degree be treated as sons. The slaves gradually coalesced with the
tribe (though not entirely); but we are told that this change took place “through
personal merits and intermarriage.” This shows that all captives were not on a level
with the freemen; probably it was only the most deserving prisoners, and the offspring
of slaves and freemen, who attended the public council and were on an equal footing
with the main body of tribesmen. Slaves may be kindly treated and yet be slaves. <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>Our opinion is, that we have here a <i lang="it">schiavitù vera e propria</i>; the more so, as the description given by Azara leads to the same conclusion.
</p>
<p>The present Caduvei, according to Boggiani, are the same people as the ancient Mbayás.
Very probably he is right here. Yet we have seen how much confusion there is in the
application of the terms Guaycurû and Mbayás; so we are a little sceptical. Moreover,
there is a great lapse of time between the early descriptions of the Mbayás and Boggiani’s
travels, and during that time their state of culture has greatly changed; from nomadic
hunters they have in the 19<sup>th</sup> century become settled agriculturists<a class="noteRef" id="n77.1src" href="#n77.1">167</a>. So we are justified in treating them separately. The Caduvei keep slaves. The slaves
are well treated, but looked upon as an inferior race. The ruder kinds of work, and
the tilling of the soil, fall to their share. As a rule they are kindly treated, without
being allowed to forget their duties. The Caduvei exchange the slaves among them for
horses, cattle and various commodities<a class="noteRef" id="n77.2src" href="#n77.2">168</a>.
</p>
<p>Pohl states, that the Canoeiros had captured a young man and treated him well<a class="noteRef" id="n77.3src" href="#n77.3">169</a>. Nothing more being added, we cannot make out whether slavery exists.
</p>
<p>Of the tribes of Central Brasil, visited by Von den Steinen, the principal are the
Bakaïri, Paressi, Bororo, Suya and Yuruna. In his description of the Bakaïri, Paressi
and Bororo he makes no mention of slavery. If it existed, this careful observer would
certainly have mentioned it. Neither is a word about slaves to be found in Hensel’s
description of the Coroados, who are often identified with the Bororo<a class="noteRef" id="n77.4src" href="#n77.4">170</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Suya Von den Steinen observed Indians of other tribes, who were kept as
slaves. The presents, which the author gave to one of these slaves, had to be delivered
to his master<a class="noteRef" id="n77.5src" href="#n77.5">171</a>.
</p>
<p>The same writer speaks of captives residing among the Yuruna; but his short remark
on this subject cannot lead us to a safe conclusion as to the existence of slavery
among them<a class="noteRef" id="n77.6src" href="#n77.6">172</a>.
</p>
<p>The Karayas on Rio Araguaya keep captive women in a somewhat slave-like state. Prisoners
of war, adopted into the <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>tribe, sometimes are made chiefs if they have distinguished themselves<a class="noteRef" id="n78.1src" href="#n78.1">173</a>. This is not very suggestive of slavery; but the details given are not sufficient
for us to arrive at a clear conclusion.
</p>
<p>On the Záparos we get this scanty information. They are always at war, killing many
of the men, and stealing the women, children and chattels of the enemies, the children
either for use as servants or for sale. A boy or girl stolen by them is commonly sold
to traders<a class="noteRef" id="n78.2src" href="#n78.2">174</a>. Apparently the author himself is in doubt, whether any of these captives are kept
as slaves.
</p>
<p>Some savage tribes of Peru are treated of by Ordinaire. In his account of the Campas
or Antis there is nothing bearing on slavery. He states that he met with a Lorenzo
child living among the Campas; but it is not clear whether this was a slave; and the
rest of his ample record makes the existence of slavery rather improbable<a class="noteRef" id="n78.3src" href="#n78.3">175</a>.
</p>
<p>About the <span class="corr" id="xd32e3491" title="Source: Conibas">Conibos</span> and kindred tribes the same writer remarks, that among their wives there are some
slaves captured from neighbouring tribes. But as he states, that all the fatiguing
work is incumbent on women, it would seem, that there are no male slaves and therefore
no slavery proper. Prisoners of war are killed at their feasts<a class="noteRef" id="n78.4src" href="#n78.4">176</a>. From a description of about a hundred years ago we learn, that these tribes kept
prisoners as slaves. Several of these slaves were observed among the Panos; the masters
treated them with as much affection as their own children and married them to their
daughters. The conquerors married the captive women in order to augment the number
of their tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n78.5src" href="#n78.5">177</a>. The details given are not sufficient to decide, whether the prisoners merged into
the tribe or constituted a slave class.
</p>
<p>Smyth and Lowe, speaking of the Sencis of Peru, remark: “They give no quarter, and
take no prisoners in the battle.… The women and children are taken for slaves, and
if there are any in infancy, or much advanced in age, they are killed as useless.”<a class="noteRef" id="n78.6src" href="#n78.6">178</a>. Whether the fate of the captive women and <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>children was really slavery, is not clear from this short note.
</p>
<p>The Guanas probably had no slaves. We are told that the head of the tribe “is obliged
to work for his subsistence, as nobody serves him”<a class="noteRef" id="n79.1src" href="#n79.1">179</a>.
</p>
<p>As little does it appear that the Yuracarés and Mocéténès are slave-keeping tribes.
The former live in families, and even in these subordination is unknown. The latter
are not warlike<a class="noteRef" id="n79.2src" href="#n79.2">180</a>. It is not, however, a first-rate authority to whom we owe these particulars.
</p>
<p>The Chiquitos, according to the same author, in their wild state attacked their neighbours,
and made prisoners, to whom they gave their own daughters as wives<a class="noteRef" id="n79.3src" href="#n79.3">181</a>. Whether these prisoners were slaves is not clear; we should rather think not.
</p>
<p>The Chapacuras were very peaceable, and but seldom attacked their neighbours<a class="noteRef" id="n79.4src" href="#n79.4">182</a>. Whether slavery existed among them we are not told.
</p>
<p>The Moxos, in D’Orbigny’s time, had already long been civilized and christianized.
What their political institutions were in their former wild state we do not know<a class="noteRef" id="n79.5src" href="#n79.5">183</a>.
</p>
<p>Muratori, speaking of the Indians of Paraguay and some neighbouring districts, states
that they kill and eat their prisoners of war. Some tribes, however, he tells us,
are more peaceful and take all pains to induce their prisoners to reside among them.
Children of prisoners are sold by some of the tribes to other nations<a class="noteRef" id="n79.6src" href="#n79.6">184</a>. From all this it would seem that slavery did not exist. But we shall presently see,
that the other information we have got does not entirely agree with Muratori’s general
statement.
</p>
<p>The principal native tribe of Paraguay were the Abipones, described at large by Dobrizhoffer.
The prisoners they made were very leniently treated. They gave them the best of their
food, and tended them when ill. The prisoners had daily opportunity to run away, but
they did not desire it, for they were very contented. They were never beaten, nor
even reproved. They hunted and fought together with the Abipones. And yet they were
not merged into the nation of the Abipones; <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>for the Abipone women generally would marry only a man of their own people; and the
men never married female prisoners, nor had they any connection with them. It appears
that every captive was assigned to an individual master. So we have here to deal with
the fact, that one man is the property of another beyond the limits of the family
proper, <i>i.e.</i> slavery, though slavery of an extraordinarily mild character<a class="noteRef" id="n80.1src" href="#n80.1">185</a>.
</p>
<p>The Payaguas in their wars killed all adult men, and preserved the women and children.
What became of the latter does not appear. The Payaguas were absolutely free and did
not recognize any difference of classes. From this it is probable, though not certain,
that they had no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n80.2src" href="#n80.2">186</a>.
</p>
<p>The Enimagas, according to Azara, were hunters; agriculture among them was incumbent
on slaves. No further particulars are given about these slaves. The Enimagas are said
formerly to have held the Mbayas in a kind of slavery; but such a subjection of a
tribe as a whole is not slavery in the true sense; slavery is subjection of individuals.
If the “slaves” the Enimagas had in Azara’s time were of the same description, they
were not slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n80.3src" href="#n80.3">187</a>. So we cannot arrive here at any definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>D’Orbigny remarks, that the Charruas when at war killed all the men, and preserved
the women and children, whom they made concubines and slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n80.4src" href="#n80.4">188</a>. As Azara’s statement is quite different, we shall translate it literally: “All are
equal; nobody serves another; or it must be some old woman who, having no means of
subsistence, joins some family, or assists at the burying of the dead”. In their wars
they kill all they meet, preserving none but the women and the children under twelve
years of age. They take their prisoners along with them, and let them enjoy their
freedom; most of them marry there and get so much accustomed to this mode of life,
that they but rarely wish to return to their own people<a class="noteRef" id="n80.5src" href="#n80.5">189</a>. Although such kind treatment is compatible with slavery, Azara’s statement about
nobody serving another is positive enough to exclude all notion of slavery. Heusser
and Claraz, who seem <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>to be well informed, make no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n81.1src" href="#n81.1">190</a>. This fact, together with the above-quoted positive statement of Azara, who on the
whole seems to be better informed than D’Orbigny<a class="noteRef" id="n81.2src" href="#n81.2">191</a>, and who also treats this matter much more fully, leads us to conclude that they
had no slaves. The lapse of time between Azara’s and D’Orbigny’s travels (from about
30 to 50 years) might account for the difference of their descriptions; but it seems
to us that so much importance need not be attached to the latter’s short remark.
</p>
<p>The Minuanes, according to Azara, resemble the Charruas in their mode of warfare,
and in acknowledging no social classes<a class="noteRef" id="n81.3src" href="#n81.3">192</a>. We may therefore suppose them to have had no slaves.
</p>
<p>The Patagons or Tehuelches, according to Musters and Falkner, have slaves. The same
is stated by Letourneau on the authority of Guimard<a class="noteRef" id="n81.4src" href="#n81.4">193</a>. And as these authors not only assert that there are slaves, but also give some particulars
about them, we may be sure that slavery really exists.
</p>
<p>About the Puelches we get some information from Azara, who calls them Pampas. “In
war they kill all adult males, preserving none but the women and young boys; these
they take home and treat in the same manner as the Charruas do. It is true, that they
impose some kinds of work upon them, and use them as slaves or servants until they
marry; but then they are as free as the others”<a class="noteRef" id="n81.5src" href="#n81.5">194</a>. Such men, who as soon as they marry are on a level with the members of the tribe,
certainly are not slaves.
</p>
<p>The Araucanians, according to D’Orbigny, kill their male enemies and enslave the women
and children<a class="noteRef" id="n81.6src" href="#n81.6">195</a>. Molina says: “The prisoners of war, as is the custom of all semibarbarous nations,
become <i>tavaichi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> slaves, until they are exchanged or ransomed”<a class="noteRef" id="n81.7src" href="#n81.7">196</a>. In his detailed description of Araucanian social life he makes no further mention
of slaves, nor do the <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>other authors<a class="noteRef" id="n82.1src" href="#n82.1">197</a>. So we may suppose that the prisoners are always exchanged or ransomed, and that
slavery is unknown among them.
</p>
<p>About the Fuegians we have this positive statement of Hyades and Déniker: “They have
no chiefs, no labourers who work for pay, and no slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n82.2src" href="#n82.2">198</a>. This statement, already valuable in itself, is corroborated by the fact, that none
of the other authors we have consulted on the subject make any mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n82.3src" href="#n82.3">199</a>.

<p>The extinct <i>Tasmanians</i> also belonged to the Australian group.
</p>
<p>Nowhere in all the books and articles we have consulted on the Australian tribes is
any mention made of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n84.1src" href="#n84.1">200</a>. Now it is true that, whereas on many of these tribes we are well informed, there
are others on which we have little information or no information at all. But here
our group-argument may be brought to bear. We have to deal here with an isolated district,
inhabited by tribes living in similar conditions and physically and psychically resembling
each other, so much so, that some ethnographers<a class="noteRef" id="n84.2src" href="#n84.2">201</a> and theorists<a class="noteRef" id="n84.3src" href="#n84.3">202</a> speak of the Australians as if they were one people, as if all Australians were in
exactly the same state of culture. This really is erroneous: <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>there are many differences in several respects between the Australian tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n85.1src" href="#n85.1">203</a>. But that they can be treated in this manner, proves that the differences are not
so very great; it is unimaginable, that Grosse would have spoken in the same way of
the American Indians or the Negroes. What we mean to say now is this: our information
on some Australian tribes is not sufficient to prove that just in that district which
each particular account relates to, slavery does not exist. But then the several accounts
strengthen each other; for taking into consideration the great likeness existing between
the Australian tribes, it is <i lang="la">a priori</i> unlikely that some of these tribes would have and others would not have slaves. Moreover,
if in any part of Australia slavery existed, our informants probably would have found
this too remarkable a fact to leave it unnoticed.
</p>
<p>As little mention is made of slaves by those ethnographers who speak of the Australians
in general<a class="noteRef" id="n85.2src" href="#n85.2">204</a>. According to Brough Smyth, “each of the principal men and priests seeks for his
food, and ministers to his own wants (with such help as he gets from his wives); and
has no one whom he can call servant”<a class="noteRef" id="n85.3src" href="#n85.3">205</a>. Gerland states that the Australians make no captives, except women sometimes<a class="noteRef" id="n85.4src" href="#n85.4">206</a>.
</p>
<p>All this makes it sufficiently clear that the Australians have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n85.5src" href="#n85.5">207</a>. The 30 tribes we have enumerated here may therefore rank as clear cases of savage
tribes without slaves.

<p class="first">Rochas, describing the New Caledonians, writes: “Slavery does not exist in the New
Caledonian society”<a class="noteRef" id="n85.6src" href="#n85.6">208</a>. Lambert tells us that the only division into social classes is that between the
chief and his parents and the common people. Captive children are adopted and enjoy
all the privileges of their adoptive <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>parents’ own children<a class="noteRef" id="n86.1src" href="#n86.1">209</a>. Brainne informs us, that there are two social classes: chiefs of various kinds,
and serfs; the latter term probably means the common people. De Vaux and Legrand make
no mention whatever of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n86.2src" href="#n86.2">210</a>. According to Glaumont there are four classes, the fourth of which is composed of
slaves (<i>en-dji-dio</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n86.3src" href="#n86.3">211</a>. But no further particulars are given about these slaves in his rather long article.
Taking all this in consideration, we are justified in concluding that slavery does
not exist.
</p>
<p>On the state of things in the Solomon Islands we are well informed by several authors.
Elton says: “If a man is married and has got a little money and a few slaves, he calls
himself a chief, but does not exercise any power over his slaves; they do pretty well
as they like”<a class="noteRef" id="n86.4src" href="#n86.4">212</a>. Guppy gives this general description of slavery in the Solomon Islands: “In the
larger islands the bush-tribes and the coast-natives wage an unceasing warfare, in
which the latter are usually the aggressors and the victors—the bushmen captured during
these raids either affording materials for the cannibal feast or being detained in
servitude by their captors. But there prevails in the group a recognized system of
slave-traffic, in which a human being becomes a marketable commodity—the equivalent
being represented in goods either of native or of foreign manufacture. This custom,
which came under the notice of Surville’s expedition, during their visit to Port Praslin
in Isabel, in 1769, obtains under the same conditions at the present time. These natives
were in the habit of making voyages of ten and twelve days’ duration with the object
of exchanging men for “fine cloths covered with designs”, articles which were manufactured
by a race of people much fairer than their own, who were in all probability the inhabitants
of Ontong Java. The servitude to which the victims of this traffic are doomed is not
usually an arduous one. But there is one grave contingency attached to his thraldom
which must be always before the mind of the captive, however lightly his chains of
service may lie upon him. When a head is required to satisfy the offended honour of
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>neighbouring chief, or when a life has to be sacrificed on the completion of a tambu
house or at the launching of a new war-canoe, the victim chosen is usually the man
who is not a free-born native of the village. He may have been bought as a child and
have lived amongst them from his boyhood up, a slave only in name, and enjoying all
the rights of his fellow natives. But no feelings of compassion can save him from
his doom; and the only consideration which he receives at the hands of those with
whom he may have lived on terms of equality for many years is to be found in the circumstance
that he gets no warning of his fate”<a class="noteRef" id="n87.1src" href="#n87.1">213</a>.
</p>
<p>The notes of the other ethnographers relate to single parts of this group. Verguet
states that in St. Christoval (in the southeastern part of the group) the slaves “are
treated as adopted children; the slave cultivates the master’s fields together with
the master himself; he helps him to prepare the food and accompanies him when hunting
or fighting; he shares in his pleasures as well as in his work; when the tribe celebrates
a feast, the slaves are not excluded from it. When full-grown, they marry into their
master’s tribe, erect their houses next to their master’s house or share the latter.
Sometimes the master does not disdain to marry his slave”<a class="noteRef" id="n87.2src" href="#n87.2">214</a>. Codrington, whose notes mainly relate to the same parts of the group, remarks: “There
is no such thing as slavery properly so called. In head-hunting expeditions prisoners
are made for the sake of their heads, to be used when occasion requires, and such
persons live with their captors in a condition very different from that of freedom,
but they are not taken or maintained for the purposes of service. In the same islands
when a successful attack and massacre enriches the victors with many heads, they spare
and carry off children, whom they bring up among their own people. Such a <i>seka</i> will certainly be killed for a head or for a sacrifice before any native member of
the community; but he lives as an adopted member, shares the work, pleasure and dangers
of those with whom he dwells, and often becomes a leading personage among them. A
refugee or a castaway is not a slave but a guest; his life is naturally <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>much less valued than that of a man of the place, and useful services are expected
from him, while he mixes freely and on equal terms with the common people”<a class="noteRef" id="n88.1src" href="#n88.1">215</a>. Guppy says: “I will turn for a moment to the subject of slavery in the eastern islands
of the group. In Ugi it is the practice of infanticide which has given rise to a slave-commerce
regularly conducted with the natives of the interior of St. Christoval. Three-fourths
of the men of this island were originally bought as youths to supply the place of
the natural offspring killed in infancy. But such natives when they attain manhood
virtually acquire their independence, and their original purchaser has but little
control over them.… Connected in the manner above shown with the subject of slavery
is the practice of cannibalism. The completion of a new tambu-house is frequently
celebrated among the St. Christoval natives by a cannibal feast. Residents in that
part of the group tell me that if the victim is not procured in a raid amongst the
neighbouring tribes of the interior, some man is usually selected from those men in
the village who were originally purchased by the chief. The doomed man is not enlightened
as to the fate which awaits him, and may perhaps have been engaged in the erection
of the very building at the completion of which his life is forfeited”. On the neighbouring
small island of Santa Anna the natives are reputed to abstain from human flesh; but
“the war-chief has acquired a considerable fortune, in a native’s point of view, by
following the profitable calling of purveyor of human flesh to the man-eaters of the
adjacent coasts of St. Christoval.… I am told that there is a faint gleam of tender
feeling shown in the case of a man who, by long residence in the village, has almost
come to be looked upon as one of themselves. He is allowed to remain in ignorance
of the dreaded moment until the last; and, perhaps, he may be standing on the beach
assisting in the launching of the very canoe in which he is destined to take his final
journey, when suddenly he is laid hold of, and in a few moments more he is being ferried
across to the man-eaters of the opposite coast”<a class="noteRef" id="n88.2src" href="#n88.2">216</a>.
</p>
<p>From the foregoing statements it appears that the so-called <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>slaves are kept either for cannibal purposes or to strengthen the number of the tribe
into which they are incorporated. Hence we may safely infer, in accordance with Codrington,
that slavery proper does not exist in the south-eastern part of the group.
</p>
<p>Somerville, describing the New Georgia group (in the centre of the Solomon Islands),
remarks: “Slavery certainly exists, but it is in so mild a form that it is scarcely
possible to detect master from man. I have never been able to elicit any facts concerning
its introduction, propagation or limits, or even if (in so many words) it existed
at all.” “I was informed that slaves are kept chiefly for their heads, which are demanded
whenever any occasion necessitates them, such as the death of the owner”<a class="noteRef" id="n89.1src" href="#n89.1">217</a>. Ribbe, too, speaks of slaves in the New Georgia group. On the isle of Wella-La-Wella
the household commonly consists of the man with his wives, slaves and unmarried daughters.
On Rubiana the master treats his slaves like his equals, but may at any time kill
and eat them<a class="noteRef" id="n89.2src" href="#n89.2">218</a>. The following statement of Woodford’s also relates to New Georgia: “On their expeditions
it is not heads alone that they bring back, but slaves as well. These are either bought
or captured alive, and it is from among these slaves that the victims are selected
in case a head is required. They appear to be well treated in other ways, and to have
as much liberty as they please; in fact, seem to be on a perfect footing of equality
and familiarity with their captors. But any day a head may be wanted to celebrate
the completion of a new canoe or other work, and one of the luckless slaves is unexpectedly
called upon to furnish it. Mercifully for the victim, the blow falls from behind and
unexpectedly. These slaves are often employed as guides to lead a party of head-hunters
unexpectedly upon the mountain villages on Ysabel, whence they originally came”<a class="noteRef" id="n89.3src" href="#n89.3">219</a>.
</p>
<p>These details do not make it quite clear whether the condition of the “slaves” in
the New Georgia group is not yet slavery or slavery in an incipient stage. We should
rather think the latter; but we are not certain about it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>Parkinson’s description of the north-western part of the group applies mainly to the
isles of Bouka and Bougainville. In Bougainville individuals belonging to the inland
tribes are sometimes enslaved by the coast people. Male slaves are not allowed to
marry. (This has probably reference to both Bouka and Bougainville). At the death
of a person of rank a slave was <span class="corr" id="xd32e4219" title="Source: formely">formerly</span>, and in some parts still is killed<a class="noteRef" id="n90.1src" href="#n90.1">220</a>. Ribbe also states that in Bougainville slavery exists, though in a mild form, most
of the slaves being children captured in war. In the Shortland Islands (to the south
of Bougainville) slaves are prisoners of war, most of them being imported from Bougainville.
They are well treated and not seldom attain power and consideration and even can marry
the chiefs relations. Those slaves, however, who are not so fortunate, run the risk
of being sacrificed at funeral feasts, at the building of a house or the launching
of a canoe. On the fields the roughest work falls to the share of the slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n90.2src" href="#n90.2">221</a>. Guppy, speaking of the small isle of Treasury (near Bougainville), says: “There
are in Treasury several men and women who, originally bought as slaves from the people
of Bouka and Bougainville, now enjoy apparently the same privileges and freedom of
action as their fellow islanders. It is sometimes not a matter of much difficulty
to single out the slaves amongst a crowd of natives. On one occasion I engaged a canoe
of Faromen to take me to a distant part of their island; and very soon after we started
I became aware from the cowed and sullen condition of one of the crew that he was
a slave. On inquiry I learned that this man had been captured when a boy in the island
of Bougainville, and I was informed that if he was to return to his native place—a
bush-village named Kiata—he would undoubtedly be killed. Although in fact a slave,
I concluded from the bearing of the other men towards him that his bondage was not
a very hard one; and he evidently appeared to enjoy most of the rights of a native
of the common class. Sukai, however, for such was his name, had to make himself generally
useful in the course of the day; and when at the close of the excursion we were seated
inside the house of a man who provided us with a meal of <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>boiled taro, sweet potatoes, and bananas, he was served with his repast on the beach
outside”<a class="noteRef" id="n91.1src" href="#n91.1">222</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that the difference between slaves and free men is more marked here than in
the other parts of the Solomon group. Neither with regard to their work nor with regard
to their social position are the slaves on a footing of equality with the free men.
The conclusion is that in the north-western part of the group slavery certainly exists.
</p>
<p>In the Nissan Islands, lying between the Solomon group and the Bismarck Archipelago,
there are no slaves. Prisoners of war are killed and eaten<a class="noteRef" id="n91.2src" href="#n91.2">223</a>.
</p>
<p>Several describers of the Fijians speak of slaves, but it is not easy to say what
they mean by the term. According to Wilkes, there are five social classes, viz. kings,
chiefs, warriors, landholders and slaves (<i>kai-si</i>). “The last have nominally little influence; but in this group, as in other countries,
the mere force of numbers is sufficient to counterbalance or overcome the force of
the prescriptive rights of the higher and less numerous classes. This has been the
case at Amban, where the people at no distant period rose against and drove out their
kings.” In another place the same writer speaks of “the <i>kai-si</i> or common people.”<a class="noteRef" id="n91.3src" href="#n91.3">224</a>. We see that “slaves,” “people” and “common people” are synonymous terms with him.
Williams equally states that the lowest class was composed of slaves, but gives no
particulars about the condition of these slaves. Prisoners of war were barbarously
tortured<a class="noteRef" id="n91.4src" href="#n91.4">225</a>. In a legend told by Seemann mention is made of a woman who had female slaves. But
in another place the distinction into social classes is drawn between the chiefs and
gentry and the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n91.5src" href="#n91.5">226</a>. Waterhouse does not speak of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n91.6src" href="#n91.6">227</a>. In Jackson’s narrative, published by Erskine, we read: “The lowest condition of
all, the consequence of some late total defeat, or conquest, is absolute slavery,
the districts where such a state exists being called <i>vanua kaisis</i> or slave lands”. “I visited nearly all the <i>vanua kaisis</i> … the meaning of <i>vanua kaisi</i> being slave-places, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>inhabitants of which are supposed to supply Tanoa’s and Thakombau’s [two chiefs’]
houses with daily food, and build the houses and keep them in repair; … they also
pay tribute periodically.” Evidently we have to deal here with subjection of districts
as such, not with enslavement of individuals. In another place of this narrative,
<i>kaisi</i> is translated with “slave or poor man”. But the same writer gives some details suggestive
of real slavery. An enemy, whose life I had saved, he says, “called and considered
himself my <i>kaisi</i> (slave)”. “Mara’s mother was saved when Tanoa conquered Lakemba, and was considered
as a prisoner, and consequently as a slave”<a class="noteRef" id="n92.1src" href="#n92.1">228</a>.
</p>
<p>Though some of the details given seem to prove that there were formerly not only people
of the lowest class and inhabitants of conquered districts, but also slaves in the
proper sense, we are not quite certain about it.
</p>
<p>Codrington’s above quoted statement, that “there is no such thing as slavery properly
so called”, applies also to a part of the New Hebrides. Meinicke, after speaking of
the chiefs, adds: “The rest of the people are free men”<a class="noteRef" id="n92.2src" href="#n92.2">229</a>. Our other informants<a class="noteRef" id="n92.3src" href="#n92.3">230</a> making no mention of slavery, we may safely infer that it does not exist here.
</p>
<p>The Bismarck Archipelago consists of Neu Pommern, Neu Mecklenburg and a number of
smaller islands. Danks gives an elaborate account of marriage customs in this group,
in which there is not a word to be found about slaves. Pfeil’s description also applies
to the whole archipelago. According to him, debtors have to work for their creditors,
but their condition is not that of slaves. Slavery, in the sense we attach to it,
does not exist. Sale of full-grown people, as well as unrewarded labour, is unknown.
Children are bought, but only for the purpose of adoption, and are not sold again.
Boys, who run away to some other tribe, are equally adopted.<a class="noteRef" id="n92.4src" href="#n92.4">231</a>
</p>
<p>The information we have got about the separate islands does not wholly agree with
these general statements.
</p>
<p>The best known part of Neu Pommern is the Gazelle Peninsula. <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>According to Hahl, slavery, in the country about Blanche Bay, is known by name, but
practically absent. On the north coast, however, it is general. The Baining (an inland
tribe) are kidnapped or captured in battle and sold by the coast people, who prefer
taking children. The slaves are not allowed to marry; they have to perform female
labour, especially to cultivate the plantations, and always run the risk of being
killed and eaten at feasts. In the districts surrounding Mount Varzin some Taulil
(another inland tribe) are kept as slaves. Parkinson, in his splendid work on the
German possessions in the South Sea, also speaks of slaves. Great numbers of Baining
were formerly enslaved by the coast people, who sold them to remote parts of the peninsula.
The Taulil also were victims of the slave raids; men and youths were killed, women
and children were made captives<a class="noteRef" id="n93.1src" href="#n93.1">232</a>.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Parkinson, describing the social organisation of the several
tribes, does not make any mention of a slave class or of the work imposed on slaves.
The social signification of slavery therefore seems to be small. Yet the foregoing
statements must lead to the conclusion that slavery exists, at least in some parts
of the peninsula.
</p>
<p>In his description of Neu Mecklenburg and neighbouring islands, Parkinson also makes
mention of slaves. On the isle of Lir or Lihir, the chief, when about to give a cannibal
repast, gathers around him his whole tribe, inclusive of the slaves, who have been
captured in war. And on St. John’s Island slaves are said formerly to have been boiled
in the hot springs. These short notes do not seem to prove sufficiently the existence
of slavery, the less so, as Romilly, in his account of Neu Mecklenburg, has not a
word about slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n93.2src" href="#n93.2">233</a>.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the tribes inhabiting the Admiralty Islands, Parkinson states that among
the Usiai prisoners of war are allowed to buy their liberty; if unable to do so, they
are made slaves. Further particulars are not given. Among the Moanus the retinue of
the chief consists of his nearest relations, further of servants or soldiers whom
he has attached to his person by payment of shell-money, and finally of youths and
boys captured <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>in battle. The servants fight and work for their lord, but enjoy a rather independent
position. We are not sure whether we have to deal here with slavery or with a voluntary
submission. So the existence of slavery in the Admiralty group, though probable in
some degree, does not seem to us to be proved as yet. As little is a positive conclusion
warranted by Parkinson’s statement, that in the group of small islands to the west
of the Admiralty group wars between the separate islands were formerly frequent, owing
to the slave stealing propensities of the natives<a class="noteRef" id="n94.1src" href="#n94.1">234</a>.
</p>
<p>In the islands of Torres Straits, according to Meinicke, there is no government and
no social division, except the division into tribes. Haddon, describing the western
tribes of Torres Straits, says: “I never heard of slavery being practised”<a class="noteRef" id="n94.2src" href="#n94.2">235</a>. So slavery is probably unknown here.
</p>
<p>The rest of this paragraph will be taken up with a survey of New Guinea and in the
first place of the Dutch part of the island.
</p>
<p>Bink and Krieger both state the Papuans of Humboldt Bay have no slaves, neither are
slaves mentioned in Koning’s account<a class="noteRef" id="n94.3src" href="#n94.3">236</a>.
</p>
<p>In the district of Tabi some men were observed, who had their hair cut short; according
to a Dorey interpreter, they were slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n94.4src" href="#n94.4">237</a>. This short note is not, however, sufficient to go upon.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Seroei are much given to the kidnapping of slaves, whom they sell.
Whether they keep any slaves themselves, does not appear<a class="noteRef" id="n94.5src" href="#n94.5">238</a>.
</p>
<p>The Papuans near Lake Sentani keep neither slaves nor pawns<a class="noteRef" id="n94.6src" href="#n94.6">239</a>.
</p>
<p>The natives of Ansus purchase many slaves, and sell slaves to Ternate traders<a class="noteRef" id="n94.7src" href="#n94.7">240</a>. In this case, too, we are not told, whether all the purchased slaves are sold abroad,
or any of them are kept by the natives.
</p>
<p>The aborigines of Windessi in their raids make prisoners <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>“to whom they give the name of <i>woman</i>, slave”<a class="noteRef" id="n95.1src" href="#n95.1">241</a>. This short note does not enable us to arrive at a clear conclusion.
</p>
<p>Goudswaard says of the Papuans of Geelvinck Bay generally: “The Papuan steals men,
makes them slaves, and despises them.” “The wars of the Papuans are little more than
raids, in which they burn the houses of their enemies, destroy their gardens, and
if possible make women and children prisoners, to restore them later on for an <span class="corr" id="xd32e4374" title="Source: edequate">adequate</span> ransom, or else to keep them as slaves or exchange them”<a class="noteRef" id="n95.2src" href="#n95.2">242</a>.
</p>
<p>The accounts, given by Van Hasselt and De Clercq, prove that slavery exists among
the Nuforese<a class="noteRef" id="n95.3src" href="#n95.3">243</a>.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Dorey and Roon belong to the Nuforese. Rosenberg gives some particulars
about slavery in Dorey, and Robidé has a few notes on slaves kept by the inhabitants
of Roon<a class="noteRef" id="n95.4src" href="#n95.4">244</a>.
</p>
<p>Slavery also exists among the natives of Arfak<a class="noteRef" id="n95.5src" href="#n95.5">245</a>.
</p>
<p>The Hattamers, however, who live in the Arfak mountains, have no slaves. “The Hattamers,”
says Robidé, “keep no slaves; in their wars with neighbouring tribes they do not enslave
the prisoners, but cut off their heads, which they bring home as trophies”<a class="noteRef" id="n95.6src" href="#n95.6">246</a>.
</p>
<p>The Karons, according to Bruijn, capture slaves from their neighbours, but whether
they keep them for their own use is not quite clear. Another author tells us that
they eat their prisoners<a class="noteRef" id="n95.7src" href="#n95.7">247</a>.
</p>
<p>The existence of slavery among the Papuans of the Gulf of Maccluer is made probable
by De Clercq’s and Strauch’s notes<a class="noteRef" id="n95.8src" href="#n95.8">248</a>. Another author observed slaves in some districts at the south-west side of this
gulf; the population of these districts is a mongrel race of Buginese, emigrants from
Serang, and Papuans<a class="noteRef" id="n95.9src" href="#n95.9">249</a>.
</p>
<p>Slavery exists on the isle of Adie and along the Gulf of Kaimani<a class="noteRef" id="n95.10src" href="#n95.10">250</a>.
</p>
<p>The Papuans of Ayambori have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n95.11src" href="#n95.11">251</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Krieger’s elaborate account of the natives of British and German New Guinea there
is not a word about slaves. Hence it would appear that they are unacquainted with
slavery and we shall presently see that this conclusion is strengthened by the information
we get about the separate tribes.
</p>
<p>Thomson states that several tribes of British New Guinea in warfare kill alike men,
women and children<a class="noteRef" id="n96.1src" href="#n96.1">252</a>, and in the descriptions of single tribes: Motu, Mowat, Toaripi, natives on the mouth
of the Wanigela River, no mention is made of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n96.2src" href="#n96.2">253</a>.
</p>
<p>As for German New Guinea, Maclay does not speak of slaves and Finsch says that every
Papuan warrior considers it an honour to kill women and children<a class="noteRef" id="n96.3src" href="#n96.3">254</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Yabim slavery does not exist<a class="noteRef" id="n96.4src" href="#n96.4">255</a>.
</p>
<p>The same is the case among the natives of the Tami Islands<a class="noteRef" id="n96.5src" href="#n96.5">256</a>.
</p>
<p>Slavery is equally unknown among the Tamoes of Bogadjim<a class="noteRef" id="n96.6src" href="#n96.6">257</a> and the natives of the adjacent Dampier Island<a class="noteRef" id="n96.7src" href="#n96.7">258</a>.

But in his very minute description of Tongan government and social classes<a class="noteRef" id="n97.4src" href="#n97.4">262</a> he gives no more particulars about these slaves; and Mariner who, according to Gerland,
is very reliable<a class="noteRef" id="n97.5src" href="#n97.5">263</a>, makes no mention of slavery. Mariner enumerates five social classes; the lowest
class were the <i>tooas</i>, the bulk of the people, consisting of <i>a.</i> a few warriors, <i>b.</i> professed cooks in the service of the chiefs, <i>c.</i> those who tilled the soil and had no <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>other occupation<a class="noteRef" id="n98.1src" href="#n98.1">264</a>. Mariner only makes mention of captive women, so it is probable that no men were
taken prisoners in their wars<a class="noteRef" id="n98.2src" href="#n98.2">265</a>. West states that there was a monarchical despotism, supported by an hereditary aristocracy.
The people were divided into several, strictly separated, classes. The lowest class
where the <i>tuas</i>, common people, subdivided into different trades: carpenters, fishermen, etc. The
feudal principle, that the whole country belonged exclusively to the king, made the
people slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n98.3src" href="#n98.3">266</a>. Such “slavery” of a whole people is not, however, slavery in the true sense of the
word. Of slavery proper West makes as little mention as Mariner. We may, therefore,
safely suppose that Meinicke and Gerland have been mistaken, and that slavery did
not exist here.
</p>
<p>With reference to Samoa Gerland speaks of two political parties who were always at
war, “but they do not destroy their adversaries”, he says, “nor enslave them, as frequently
members of the same family belong to different parties”<a class="noteRef" id="n98.4src" href="#n98.4">267</a>. According to Meinicke the prisoners were at different times differently disposed
of; but among these modes of treatment slavery is not mentioned<a class="noteRef" id="n98.5src" href="#n98.5">268</a>. Wilkes states that their wars “were attended with great cruelty, and neither old
or young of either sex were spared”<a class="noteRef" id="n98.6src" href="#n98.6">269</a>. Turner, a good authority, remarks: “Prisoners, if men, were generally killed; if
women, distributed among the conquerors”<a class="noteRef" id="n98.7src" href="#n98.7">270</a>. We are not told whether these women were married, or kept in a slave-like state;
but even in the last case this would be slavery of women only, and therefore not slavery
in the proper sense. Krämer is the only author who speaks of slaves. The conquered
party had to ask the pardon of the conquerors and to bring firewood as if to show
that they considered themselves worth to be eaten like pigs. Often also they had to
perform degrading work as slaves (<i>pologa</i>), to pay a tribute or even to furnish human flesh for cannibal purposes<a class="noteRef" id="n98.8src" href="#n98.8">271</a>. It would seem that this degrading work was imposed upon the conquered as a temporary
punishment and that we have not to deal here with a permanent system of forced labour
as among slave-keeping tribes. This being the only <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>reference to slavery in Krämer’s very detailed description of the Samoans, and slavery
not being mentioned by any of our other informants<a class="noteRef" id="n99.1src" href="#n99.1">272</a>, we may safely infer that it did not exist.
</p>
<p>Gardiner, in his excellent article on Rotuma, says: “Slaves as such did not properly
exist”<a class="noteRef" id="n99.2src" href="#n99.2">273</a>.
</p>
<p>Gerland and Meinicke, enumerating the social classes in the Rarotonga group (or Hervey
Islands, or Cook’s Islands), make no mention of slaves. According to Meinicke, the
lowest class are the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n99.3src" href="#n99.3">274</a>. So slavery seems to have been unknown here.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti, according to Ellis, “the lowest class included the <i>titi</i> and the <i>teuteu</i>, the slaves and servants; the former were those who had lost their liberty in battle,
or who, in consequence of the defeat of the chieftains to whom they were attached,
had become the property of the conquerors. This kind of slavery appears to have existed
among them from time immemorial. Individuals captured in actual combat, or who fled
to the chief for protection when disarmed or disabled in the field, were considered
the slaves of the captor or chief by whom they were protected. The women, children
and others who remained in the districts of the vanquished, were also regarded as
belonging to them; and the lands they occupied, together with their fields and plantations,
were distributed among the victors.… If peace continued, the captive frequently regained
his liberty after a limited servitude, and was permitted to return to his own land,
or remain in voluntary service with his master”<a class="noteRef" id="n99.4src" href="#n99.4">275</a>. Though the second kind of slaves Ellis enumerates, the subjects of vanquished chiefs,
probably were not slaves, and the frequent liberating of captive slaves proves that
slavery was not of great significance, it would seem from Ellis’s account that to
a limited extent it was present. Another ancient writer, however, tells us that the
lowest class were the common servants, called <i>toutou</i>, or, when they were in the service of women, <i>tuti</i>. Nobody was obliged to serve longer than he liked. The <i>manahoune</i> or peasants, who worked for the nobility, were also free to change their master or
remove to another district. Hence we should infer that slavery did not <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>exist<a class="noteRef" id="n100.1src" href="#n100.1">276</a>. Moerenhout says: In the Society Islands there were no slaves; the people served
the chiefs voluntarily. Prisoners of war, men, women, and children, were almost always
mercilessly murdered<a class="noteRef" id="n100.2src" href="#n100.2">277</a>. Considering the details given by Ellis, who was very well informed, we are inclined,
notwithstanding the contrary statements of the other writers, to conclude that slavery
existed in Tahiti, but we are not quite certain about it.
</p>
<p>Of Hawaii Ellis says: “The wives and children of those whom they had defeated were
frequently made slaves, and attached to the soil for its cultivation, and, together
with the captives, treated with great cruelty.” Captives were sometimes spared, “though
perhaps spared only to be slaves, or to be sacrificed when the priests should require
human victims. The persons of the captives were the property of the victors, and their
lives entirely at their disposal.” But in enumerating the social classes he makes
no mention of slaves. “In the fourth [lowest] rank may be included the small farmers,
who rent from ten to twenty or thirty acres of land; the mechanics … indeed, all the
labouring classes, those who attach themselves to some chief or farmer, and labour
on his land for their food and clothing, as well as those who cultivate small portions
of land for their own advantage”<a class="noteRef" id="n100.3src" href="#n100.3">278</a>. In the accounts of the other writers, who knew the ancient institutions of Hawaii
by observation or personal information, we do not find anything tending to prove that
slavery existed. Wilkes, in his very detailed account of government and land tenure,
does not speak of slaves. “The authority” he says “descended in the scale of rank,
rising from the lowest class of servants to tenants, agents, landholders, land-owners,
petty chiefs, high chiefs, and the king”<a class="noteRef" id="n100.4src" href="#n100.4">279</a>. Chamisso expressly states that slavery was absent. The common people were entirely
subjected to the chiefs, but there were no slaves or serfs. Peasants and servants
were allowed to remove to any place they liked. The people were free; they could be
killed, but not sold or retained<a class="noteRef" id="n100.5src" href="#n100.5">280</a>. Remy tells us that the common people were heavily oppressed by the chiefs. Slaves
are not mentioned by him. Prisoners were sacrificed<a class="noteRef" id="n100.6src" href="#n100.6">281</a>. All this renders the existence <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>of slavery in ancient Hawaii very improbable and so we think we are justified, notwithstanding
the second-hand information, furnished by Meinicke, that there were a few slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n101.1src" href="#n101.1">282</a>, and Marcuse’s short remark, that “to allure the sharks, they occasionally made human
sacrifices, especially among the slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n101.2src" href="#n101.2">283</a>, in concluding that slavery did not exist.
</p>
<p>Hale states that in the Marquesas Islands there were no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n101.3src" href="#n101.3">284</a>. The same follows from Radiguet’s description. According to this writer, the natives
were divided into the nobles and the common people. The latter served the nobles,
but were free at any time to leave their employers<a class="noteRef" id="n101.4src" href="#n101.4">285</a>. According to Meinicke prisoners were either sacrificed and eaten, or spared and
adopted into the conquering tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n101.5src" href="#n101.5">286</a>. De Rocquefeuil also states that the prisoners were eaten, unless, by the priests’
intervention, they were buried; at any rate they were killed<a class="noteRef" id="n101.6src" href="#n101.6">287</a>. Moerenhout tells us that the sole object of their wars was to obtain a cannibal
repast<a class="noteRef" id="n101.7src" href="#n101.7">288</a>. From all this we may safely infer that there were no slaves and that Gerland, stating
that “slaves were rare; like the foreigners, who were always regarded as enemies,
they had no rights, could be quite arbitrarily treated and even killed”<a class="noteRef" id="n101.8src" href="#n101.8">289</a>, has mistaken for slaves persons intended to be sacrificed. Letourneau holds the
same view of the matter: “Everything seems to indicate, that slavery did not exist
in the Marquesas Islands”<a class="noteRef" id="n101.9src" href="#n101.9">290</a>.
</p>
<p>The natives of Tukopia, according to Gerland, formerly kept slaves, who were prisoners
of war<a class="noteRef" id="n101.10src" href="#n101.10">291</a>. No more details are given.
</p>
<p>Wilkes, speaking of the Paumotu group, observes that Anaa or Chain Island “is said
to contain five thousand inhabitants, which large number is accounted for by the conquest
of the other islands, and taking their inhabitants off as captives”. The influence
of the missionaries caused a change in “the treatment of their captives, whom they
allowed to return, if they chose, to their own island; but very many of them had married
at Anaa, and became permanent residents there, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>few have taken advantage of the permission to return”<a class="noteRef" id="n102.1src" href="#n102.1">292</a>. Whether the captives mentioned here were kept as slaves is not clear. Moerenhout
tells us that the natives of the Paumotu group often preserved their prisoners to
eat them later on at feasts<a class="noteRef" id="n102.2src" href="#n102.2">293</a>. We cannot arrive at a definite conclusion here.
</p>
<p>Geiseler states that on Easter Island male prisoners of war were formerly eaten. Captured
women and girls, however, were not killed, but given to young warriors. Slaves are
not mentioned. The king had absolute power over the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n102.3src" href="#n102.3">294</a>. It would seem that slavery was absent here; but we are not quite certain about it,
as Geiseler describes a state of things existing long before his visit to the island.
</p>
<p>In the Abgarris, Marqueen and Tasman groups, according to Parkinson, there are three
social classes, the chiefs and their parents, the nobles and priests, and the common
people<a class="noteRef" id="n102.4src" href="#n102.4">295</a>. Hence we may safely infer, that slavery does not exist.

<p class="first">According to Meinicke none of the describers of the Marshall Islands make mention
of slaves. Gerland, too, does not speak of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n102.5src" href="#n102.5">296</a>. According to Hernsheim the lowest class is composed <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>of the poor, the <i>armidwon</i> or <i>kajur</i>. They are forbidden to take more than one wife. The next class is that of the <i>leadagedag</i>, who own property, have in most instances three wives, and are provided with food
by the <i>kajur</i><a class="noteRef" id="n103.1src" href="#n103.1">297</a>. Kubary says: “The common people are called <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e5002" title="Source: armij">armidj</span> kajur</i> and form the greater part of the subjects. They have no property, except the land
allotted to them by the chief, who can take it from them at his pleasure. Every week
they have, each of them, to provide the chief with prepared food, the quantity and
quality of which are determined”. These people, according to Kubary, form the lowest
class<a class="noteRef" id="n103.2src" href="#n103.2">298</a>. Hager quite agrees with Kubary, to whom he frequently refers<a class="noteRef" id="n103.3src" href="#n103.3">299</a>. Senfft states that sale or pawning of men is unknown. Captives, domestic slaves,
debt-slaves etc. are not found. The lowest class are the <i>armidj kajur</i> or common people, who own no property. Hence we might infer that slavery does not
exist. But in another place the same writer remarks that only the upper classes (kings,
relations of kings and chiefs of districts) are free, the rest of the population being
unfree and presenting all the characteristics of slaves. The <i>armidj</i> has no rights, everything he acquires is the property of his chief. The chief has
over him the right of life and death. Yet we do not think the writer means to say
that these people of very low standing are really slaves, <i>i.e.</i> the individual property of the chiefs. They are not bought and sold, as is generally
the case with slaves. The <i>armidj</i> do not become such through captivity in war or indebtedness, the common manners in
which people are made slaves. So some of the ordinary features of slavery are wanting.
This already renders the existence of slavery doubtful. But we think the following
passage in Senfft’s description clearly shows that the <i>armidj</i> are not slaves: “The <i>armidj</i> cannot leave the tribe without the consent of his chief, but as most often he belongs
by birth to several chiefs, he can go over from the tribe of one of his chiefs to
that of another, <i>i.e.</i>, he can place himself under the immediate control of the other chief by rendering
him services, especially by tilling his land. He commonly does so, when he is badly
treated.” From this it appears that the <i>armidj</i> is not <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>the individual property of his chief; else he would not be able to change his condition
so easily. We think his relation to the chief is rather that of a subject to a petty
despot<a class="noteRef" id="n104.1src" href="#n104.1">300</a>. This conclusion is strengthened by what we learn from other recent descriptions.
Krämer makes no mention of slaves. The lowest class, according to him, are the <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e5042" title="Source: kadjur">kajur</span></i> or common people<a class="noteRef" id="n104.2src" href="#n104.2">301</a>. In a report regarding the isle of Jaluit it is equally stated that the lowest class
are the <i>armidj <span class="corr" id="xd32e5050" title="Source: kadjur">kajur</span></i> or common people, who own no land. They have to work for the landowners and to provide
them with food. This is more suggestive of tenancy than of slavery. It is true that
the writer calls them unfree; but then he says, that their becoming free was synonymous
with their rising to the rank of a chief, so it seems that by “unfree” he means people
whose condition is below that of the chiefs and nobles<a class="noteRef" id="n104.3src" href="#n104.3">302</a>. Taking all this into consideration, we think we may safely infer that there are
no slaves in the Marshall group.
</p>
<p>Though the isle of Nauru is often regarded as belonging to the Marshall group, its
situation is rather isolated and the social organisation of the population is different
from that on the other islands of the group, so we think we must treat it separately.
Krämer remarks that there are three classes: chiefs, middle class and slaves. The
chiefs have unlimited power over the slaves, who are not allowed to marry without
their consent. A murderer in most cases has to yield his land to the parents of his
victim, but when there are attenuating circumstances, he is allowed to give slaves
as a compensation<a class="noteRef" id="n104.4src" href="#n104.4">303</a>. Jung gives more details. He speaks of serfs or slaves, but what he tells about them
is not very suggestive of slavery. The serfs, unlike the other classes, own no land.
A native who is supposed to have killed another by means of sorcery becomes the serf
of the parents of his victim and his property is taken away. Many families stand in
the relation of serfs to the chiefs and other people of rank. The power of the lords
over these slaves is said formerly to have been very great. The origin of serfdom
was this. In their wars, families belonging to the conquered party were driven from
their lands and had to seek their subsistence <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>elsewhere. They then applied to a powerful chief, put themselves under his protection
and became entirely dependent on him. In later times these serfs were placed by the
chief as agents on their own former property on condition of delivering the produce
to him. It then sometimes happened that these agents or their children behaved as
owners of the lands they lived upon and so came into conflict with the chief<a class="noteRef" id="n105.1src" href="#n105.1">304</a>. From this account it appears that the so-called serfs nowadays are not in a slave-like
condition. Whether in former times they were really slaves is not clear; we should
rather think their state was one of voluntary submission to a landowner; but we cannot
arrive at a definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>Gerland, minutely describing the social classes on the several Caroline Islands, only
in one passage speaks of slaves. According to him, on the isle of Ponape there are
three classes: chiefs, freemen, and slaves. Christian also makes mention of slaves.
“After the chief ruler come twelve orders of chiefs, Chaulik being the smallest title
of all, and after these the Aramach-mal, or common folk, and the Litu, or slave-class”<a class="noteRef" id="n105.2src" href="#n105.2">305</a>. But the only details given about these slaves are that the land “belongs exclusively
to the two upper classes; the third class are attached to the soil on which they live”<a class="noteRef" id="n105.3src" href="#n105.3">306</a>. We are inclined to think that these so-called “slaves” are really free people of
low standing, the more so as on the isle of Kusaie, also belonging to the Caroline
group, the common people are subjected to the higher classes who own all the land<a class="noteRef" id="n105.4src" href="#n105.4">307</a>. Kubary, describing the Mortlock Islands (belonging to the same group), says: “Except
the division into tribes, there is no social division in the Caroline Islands, such
as into classes, ranks, secret societies, etc.; and I believe that all suppositions
of former observers relating to such a state of things result from ignorance of tribal
government. With these natives the notions of “noble”, “gentleman”, “commoner” have
but a relative value; and special titles such as “king”, “chieftain”, “prince”, etc.
depend wholly upon the individual pleasure of the observer”<a class="noteRef" id="n105.5src" href="#n105.5">308</a>. The same writer tells us that on the isle of Ruk in warfare <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>“such captives as may accidentally be taken are killed,” which statement is not very
suggestive of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n106.1src" href="#n106.1">309</a>. Gräffe, compiling Tetens and Kubary’s notes on the inhabitants of Yap, speaks of
slaves: “The population is composed of three classes, chiefs, freemen, and slaves
or <i>pomilingais</i>. The latter live together in separate villages and are obliged daily to provide the
freemen with agricultural products, and whenever the chiefs require it to aid in constructing
houses and canoes. Everything the slaves possess, even their wives and daughters,
may at any time be required by the freemen and used at their pleasure. As we have
already hinted, the slaves are not allowed to wear the head-ornaments that the freemen
are in the habit of wearing, not even the combs worn in the hair; and when waiting
upon the chiefs, they must approach them in a creeping, bowing attitude. One would,
however, fail in supposing, that all labour is exclusively incumbent on the slave-class.
They are only bound to definite taxes, viz. to a tribute of food, and of mats and
other materials for housebuilding; and their slave-state consists rather in a low
and dependent condition than in being taxed with labour”<a class="noteRef" id="n106.2src" href="#n106.2">310</a>. From this last sentence we should infer, that these people are not slaves, but only
a despised lowest class. A slave always has an individual master, whereas these people
are subjected to the higher classes <i>en bloc</i>. Krämer, in his short description of the isle of Yap, equally speaks of slaves (<i>milingai</i>). They live in separate villages. “Their villages, however, differ little from those
of the free inhabitants of Yap, and yet the <i>milingai</i> are a kind of slaves or at least derive their origin from slaves.” Their social position
is lower than that of the other natives. This description, in which no mention is
made of the <i>milingai</i> serving individual masters, is little suggestive of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n106.3src" href="#n106.3">311</a>. According to Volkens, there are two classes, the <i>pilun</i>, who are free and the <i>pimlingai</i>, who are slaves. “There are no domestic slaves, the dwellings of the free people
and those of the slaves being strictly separated. Generally speaking, to each <i>pilun</i> country belong one or more <i>pimlingai</i> countries; the former are on the coast, the latter in the less <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>fertile interior”. “The slaves do not pay any tribute, but are obliged to perform
in the <i>pilun</i> country without payment public and private works, such as thatching roofs, building
roads and dams, etc.”<a class="noteRef" id="n107.1src" href="#n107.1">312</a>. From this account also we may infer that the so-called slaves, who work for the
governing districts, not for individual masters, are not really slaves. Slavery therefore
seems to be unknown in the Caroline Islands.
</p>
<p>In Gerland’s detailed account of government and social classes among the ancient inhabitants
of the Marianne Islands no mention is made of slavery; and as this author uses this
word in a too wide rather than in a too restricted sense, we may safely suppose that
there were no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n107.2src" href="#n107.2">313</a>.
</p>
<p>Kubary tells us, that “among the Pelau Islanders there can be no question of a division
of the people into ranks or classes, of a nobility in our sense of the word”<a class="noteRef" id="n107.3src" href="#n107.3">314</a>. In another place he states that a chief’s wants are generally provided for by the
work of dependent relatives, who are a kind of adopted children. If their work does
not suit them, they leave their employer<a class="noteRef" id="n107.4src" href="#n107.4">315</a>. Semper speaks of a class of bondmen (<i lang="de">Hörigen</i>); but in another place he states that they work for wages; so they are neither slaves
nor serfs, but a despised working class<a class="noteRef" id="n107.5src" href="#n107.5">316</a>. We may safely conclude that slavery does not exist here<a class="noteRef" id="n107.6src" href="#n107.6">317</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Kingsmill or Gilbert Islands, according to Wilkes, there are three classes:
chief (<i>nea</i>), landholders (<i>katoka</i>), and slaves (<i>kawa</i>). “The <i>katokas</i> are persons who possess land, but are not of noble birth; many of these were originally
slaves, who have obtained land by acts of bravery, or through the favour of their
chiefs. The <i>kawas</i> are those who possess no land, and no one from whom they can claim support”. “They
have no term to designate a poor man, except that of slave. Anyone who owns land can
always call upon others to provide him with a house, canoe, and the necessaries of
life; but one who has none is considered as a slave, and can hold no property <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>whatever”<a class="noteRef" id="n108.1src" href="#n108.1">318</a>. It is evident that these <i>kawas</i>, as described by Wilkes, are not slaves, but a subjected and despised class of people
destitute of land. Meinicke enumerates the following classes: chiefs (in Tarawa: <i>nea</i> or <i>oamata</i>, in Makin: <i>jomata</i>), free landholders (in Tarawa: <i>katoka</i>, in Makin: <i>tiomata</i>), and the common people (in Tarawa: <i>kawa</i>, in Makin: <i>rang</i>); and he adds: “There are also slaves, who originally were captives, and whose children
have remained such”<a class="noteRef" id="n108.2src" href="#n108.2">319</a>. So the <i>kawa</i>, called slaves by Wilkes, are called freemen by Meinicke, according to whom there
is a class of slaves still below them. Behm asserts that on Makin there are slaves
besides the three other classes<a class="noteRef" id="n108.3src" href="#n108.3">320</a>. The best description is given by Parkinson. According to him there are kings (these
only on some islands); further great landholders; then the class of small landholders.
Then there are two subjected classes. One is the class of the <i>te torre</i>, who live as vassals on the lands of the great landholders; they get a small piece
of land for their own use; they must provide their lord with men when in war, and
bring him the number of cocoanuts he desires, and what he needs for his household.
The lowest class are the <i>te bei</i> or <i>kaungo</i>. They have no property, no land to live upon; they live with the great landholders
by whom they are maintained; they on their part must work for their lord, <i>i.e.</i> fish, prepare food, etc. The lord, by giving them a piece of land, can raise them
to the class of the <i>te torre</i>. These two classes have no voice in government matters; they follow their lord without
grumbling; his will is their will; an offence against the lord is regarded by them
as a personal offence, and avenged as such. Generally no one marries outside his class.
In ordinary life there is no difference between master and vassal; they often sleep
on the same mat; they drink, dance and play together; they wear the same kind of dress.
When a poor man dies, a wealthy inhabitant of the village generally provides for his
family; but they must labour for him and are, so to speak, his slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n108.4src" href="#n108.4">321</a>. We have to examine now, whether these two lowest classes are slave-classes. We may
remark, first, that, whereas most ethnographers make a large use of the word “slave”,
Parkinson does not use it, except in <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>the last sentence, and there with the qualification “so to speak”. Moreover, some
particulars are not mentioned, which we should expect to find in such an elaborate
description, if slavery really existed; <i>e.g.</i> it is not stated that the subjected persons are bought and sold; nor that care is
taken that they do not run away; nor that the master is not at all, or only to a limited
extent, responsible for his behaviour towards the person who serves him. As little
does it appear, that these vassals become such in the same manner in which men generally
become slaves. It is only stated that the family of a deceased poor man fall into
a state of dependence upon a rich inhabitant of the village; but it is not clear,
whether they voluntarily or involuntarily join the rich man’s family. The principal
objects of property, says Parkinson, are houses, lands, and canoes<a class="noteRef" id="n109.1src" href="#n109.1">322</a>. Were there slaves, they would have been mentioned here too. Krämer states that there
are chiefs, a nobility (<i>aomata</i>), a middle class (<i>te vau</i>), and slaves (<i>te kanua</i>). A noble may not marry a girl of the middle class or a slave girl, nor is he allowed
to have any connection with a female slave who is his own subject<a class="noteRef" id="n109.2src" href="#n109.2">323</a>. Krämer’s use of the word slave, without any particulars suggestive of slavery, cannot
impair the inference, to which Wilkes’s notes and Parkinson’s detailed account lead
us, that there are no slaves on the Gilbert Islands.

<p>Schurtz asserts that in Polynesia and Micronesia slaves are found everywhere; and
Gerland is of the same opinion regarding Polynesia<a class="noteRef" id="n109.3src" href="#n109.3">324</a>. Our survey of both these groups shows that these writers are wrong: in Micronesia
slavery is probably quite unknown; in Polynesia absence of slavery is the rule, slavery
the exception.

the Jakun.
</p>
<p>Among the Sakai, according to De Morgan “the debtor and his family work for the creditor
during one or two moons, according to the decision of the panghulu (village-chief)”.
This certainly is a commencement of debt-slavery; but such compulsory labour, limited
beforehand to one or two months, is not yet slavery in the true sense.
</p>
<p>Skeat and Blagden state that, among the Benua-Jakun, crimes of all kinds might be
expatiated by the payment of fines. If the offender failed to pay the fine, he became
the slave of his victim. No more details being added, the existence of slavery does
not seem to us to be quite certain.
</p>
<p>As neither in Skeat and Blagden’s exhaustive work, nor in the other books and articles
we have consulted, any further mention is made of slaves, we are justified in concluding
that these tribes, with the exception perhaps of a division of the Jakun, do not practise

</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Among the Battas of Silindung slavery has never existed, according to Meerwaldt<a class="noteRef" id="n111.7src" href="#n111.7">336</a>. Whether he means only slavery in the restricted sense, or also pawning, is not clear.
</p>
<p>The Toba Battas, according to Meerwaldt, formerly had slaves; but now slavery is dying
out under Dutch influence. Van Dijk, who visited the Habinsaran district in the Toba-lands,
states that in some parts of the district there were slaves, in others there were
not. Whether the latter fact is to be accounted for by Dutch influence, does not appear
from his very short notes<a class="noteRef" id="n111.8src" href="#n111.8">337</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Lubus we have found only two short articles, in which slavery is not mentioned;
but this does not prove very much<a class="noteRef" id="n111.9src" href="#n111.9">338</a>.
</p>
<p>None of the describers of the Kubus make any mention of slaves; so we may suppose,
that slavery does not exist among them<a class="noteRef" id="n111.10src" href="#n111.10">339</a>.
</p>
<p>De Groot gives a detailed account of slavery and pawning in the Lampong districts<a class="noteRef" id="n111.11src" href="#n111.11">340</a>.
</p>
<p>In Nias slavery certainly exists<a class="noteRef" id="n111.12src" href="#n111.12">341</a>.
</p>
<p>The Mentawei Islanders very probably have no slaves. None of their describers make
any mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n111.13src" href="#n111.13">342</a>. “Their whole warfare consists of treacherous attacks, in which nobody’s life is
spared”<a class="noteRef" id="n111.14src" href="#n111.14">343</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the Anambas, Natuna and Tambelan Islands, belonging to the Lingga-Riouw group,
there are debtor-slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n112.1src" href="#n112.1">344</a>.
</p>
<p>Most of the writers on Enggano make no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n112.2src" href="#n112.2">345</a>. According to Walland, the Engganese wear ornaments in their ear-laps, which are
pierced for that purpose. If anybody’s ear-lap is broken, he incurs great disgrace;
he is no longer listened to in any deliberation, nor considered a notable in his tribe,
and becomes the slave of his relatives, for whom he is obliged to work. And Rosenberg
says: “If a criminal does not pay the fine, this is done by his kindred; but if they
are unable to pay, they sell him as a slave. So slavery exists; but it is of a very
mild kind, and the number of slaves is very small”<a class="noteRef" id="n112.3src" href="#n112.3">346</a>. The fact that both authors speak of slavery only in connection with these particular
cases, whereas the others do not speak of it at all, makes us doubt, whether what
Walland and Rosenberg call slavery is slavery in the true sense. So we cannot come
to a clear conclusion.

<p>Of the Dyaks of Simpang he says the same, and adds that pawning is unknown amongst
them. Here too we cannot arrive at a clear conclusion<a class="noteRef" id="n113.10src" href="#n113.10">363</a>.
</p>
<p>The Rambai- and Sebruang-Dyaks probably have no slaves; for it is stated, that their
chiefs have no privileges; only, when some accident, illness for instance, prevents
them from cultivating their own rice-fields, this is done by the people<a class="noteRef" id="n113.11src" href="#n113.11">364</a>. If there were slaves, the chiefs would not have to cultivate their own rice-fields.
Moreover our informant, in his fairly detailed description, would probably have mentioned
slavery, if it existed.

he was writing (1875), or that it had never existed, is not clear. Van der Miesen,
writing in 1902, states that, if a man is unable to pay his debt, he is obliged to
serve his creditor till his parents have collected the required sum<a class="noteRef" id="n115.14src" href="#n115.14">401</a>. No further mention of slavery or pawning is made in his detailed description. So
we are left in doubt as to the former existence of slavery here.

<p>In Blumentritt’s rather short article on the Bungians no mention is made of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n116.7src" href="#n116.7">409</a>.
</p>
<p>From Venturillo’s and Miller’s descriptions it appears that slavery is unknown among
the Bataks of Palawan<a class="noteRef" id="n116.8src" href="#n116.8">410</a>.
</p>
<p>Jenks, in his minute account of the Bontoc Igorot of Northern Luzon, gives a full
description of the division of labour among them. The poor serve the rich for wages.
Slaves are not mentioned. Under the heading of “conquest” he remarks: “Certain Igorot,
as those of Asin, make forcible conquests on their neighbours and carry away persons
for slavery. But Bontoc has no such conquests”. Schadenberg, too, does not speak of
slaves among the Bontoc people<a class="noteRef" id="n116.9src" href="#n116.9">411</a>. Hence we may safely infer that the Bontoc Igorot do not keep slaves.
</p>
<p>About the other divisions of the Igorot we are not so well informed. From Jenks’s
above-quoted incidental remark it would appear that some of them practise slavery.
But as in the other sources<a class="noteRef" id="n116.10src" href="#n116.10">412</a> we do not find anything strengthening this presumption, we cannot arrive at a positive
conclusion.
</p>
<p>Reed, describing the Negritos of Zambales (along the western coast of Luzon), says:
“Notwithstanding the statements of Montano that the Negritos have no slaves and know
nothing of slavery, the reverse is true, in Zambales at least; so say the Negritos
and also the Filipinos who have spent several years among them. The word “a-li-pun”
is used among them to <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>express such social condition. As has been stated, a man caught steeling may become
a slave, as also may a person captured from another rancheria, a child left without
support, a person under death sentence, or a debtor. It was also stated that if a
man committed a crime and escaped a relative could be seized as a slave. It will take
a long acquaintance with the Negritos and an intimate knowledge of their customs to
get at the truth of these statements”. From this last sentence, together with the
fact that the other writers on the Negritos we have consulted do not make any mention
of slavery, we must infer that it is doubtful whether slavery exists among the Negritos<a class="noteRef" id="n117.1src" href="#n117.1">413</a>.

<p class="first">The Hovas and kindred tribes are considered by many investigators to be Malays. Schurtz
also classifies them among the Malays in the widest sense of the word<a class="noteRef" id="n117.2src" href="#n117.2">414</a>. The anthropologists do not yet agree about the origin of the Hovas; but as the divisions
of this chapter are only intended to give the reader a clear survey of the matter,
and not to answer any anthropological purpose, we may treat them here as well as elsewhere.
</p>
<p>The existence of slavery among the Hovas is proved by the statements of several good
authorities<a class="noteRef" id="n117.3src" href="#n117.3">415</a>.
</p>
<p>Sibree, describing the Betsileo, Betsimisaraka, Bara, Tankay or Bezanozano, Sihanaka
and Tanala, makes no mention of slavery; but his notes are not detailed enough to
make its non-existence certain<a class="noteRef" id="n117.4src" href="#n117.4">416</a>.
</p>
<p>Hildebrandt and Grandidier speak of slaves among the Antankarana<a class="noteRef" id="n117.5src" href="#n117.5">417</a>. As, however, in their short notes only slaves of the king are mentioned, we may
put this down as a doubtful case.

<p>We shall add here a few notes on some Malay peoples, that have attained to a too high
degree of civilization to be quoted here as instances of savages having or not having
slaves. The purpose of this addition is only to complete this survey of the Archipelago,
and to show what literature exists on these peoples.
</p>
<p>In Java slavery has not prevailed for centuries. “In Mohammedan law a large place
is taken up with regulations of slavery, of the rights of masters and slaves, and
of the manner in which the latter can acquire their freedom. The peculiar state of
the aboriginal Javanese society prevented the application of nearly all precepts relating
to this matter. Before the introduction of Islam slavery proper seems to have been
unknown; the universal subjection of the mass of the people, as Sudras, to the members
of the higher castes, had made slavery superfluous. Nor has Islam introduced slavery
into Java; for although in later times Javanese chiefs in a few cases kept slaves,
this <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>was done in imitation of the Europeans, and the legal status of these slaves depended
on Roman-Dutch law, not on Mohammedan law.” The <i>desas</i> or villages, that did not accept Islam, were conquered; yet their inhabitants were
not enslaved, but the whole villages <i>en bloc</i> were reduced to a subjected state: they had to pay extraordinary tributes and to
perform services to the Sultans. This ancient state of things remained in force, even
when gradually the whole population accepted Islam. Even the concubines of the chiefs
are not captured or purchased slaves, but women taken from among the people<a class="noteRef" id="n121.1src" href="#n121.1">418</a>. This passage from Veth’s book does not, however, inform us as to whether there were
slaves before the Hindu invasion and some time after. In the “<span lang="nl">Encyclopaedie voor <span class="corr" id="xd32e6606" title="Source: Nederlandsch Indië">Nederlandsch-Indië</span></span>” it is stated<a class="noteRef" id="n121.2src" href="#n121.2">419</a>, that in old times Africans were imported as slaves into Java, as appears from an
inscription of 800 A.D. The continued investigation of Javanese history will probably
throw more light on the subject.
</p>
<p>In Bali slavery certainly exists, or at least formerly existed; but, according to
Liefrinck, only the chief and his family have slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n121.3src" href="#n121.3">420</a>. Waanders, however, who gives a detailed account of the Balinese slave-system, asserts
that even Sudras have slaves, though he speaks but incidentally of this<a class="noteRef" id="n121.4src" href="#n121.4">421</a>. Perhaps the slaves kept by the common people are only debtor-slaves; for, according
to Liefrinck, debtors serve their creditors, and are sometimes sold by auction<a class="noteRef" id="n121.5src" href="#n121.5">422</a>. Tonkes, who has (rather deficiently) collected the literature on the Balinese, does
not solve the question. At any rate, slavery here is not a fundamental institution.
The chief has great power, and the Hindu caste-system prevails, so that the social
classes are widely separated; the Sudras are at the mercy of the upper castes<a class="noteRef" id="n121.6src" href="#n121.6">423</a>. Slavery, though discountenanced by the Dutch government, still prevailed as late
as 1877<a class="noteRef" id="n121.7src" href="#n121.7">424</a>.
</p>
<p>Liefrinck states that in Lombok there were imported slaves and native-born slaves
or serfs; the condition of the latter was much better than of the former, but they
could be sold for debts and then became slaves in the strict sense<a class="noteRef" id="n121.8src" href="#n121.8">425</a>. Van Eck <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>has also some notes on Lombok. According to him, Sasaks and Balinese of the Sudra-caste
frequently become slaves of the rich, as a punishment or in payment of debts<a class="noteRef" id="n122.1src" href="#n122.1">426</a>.
</p>
<p>Van Hasselt gives a detailed account of slavery among the Malays of Menangkabao. In
1876 the slaves and pawns on the West Coast of Sumatra were emancipated by the Dutch
government. But in the territories which are not under Dutch control slavery in van
Hasselt’s time was still carried on to a great extent. In the little independent states
a chief’s power depended upon the number of his slaves, who tilled his lands and strengthened
his force in warfare. The slaves in the restricted sense were purchased and captured
persons and their offspring. Besides these there were pawns<a class="noteRef" id="n122.2src" href="#n122.2">427</a>. Several further particulars are given in Van Hasselt’s valuable book. Willinck,
in his recent work on the laws of the Malays of Menangkabao, describes their slave
system in details<a class="noteRef" id="n122.3src" href="#n122.3">428</a>.
</p>
<p>In many other Malay districts of Sumatra slavery exists or formerly existed<a class="noteRef" id="n122.4src" href="#n122.4">429</a>.
</p>
<p>Particular mention has to be made of Atjeh, where slavery prevails to a great extent<a class="noteRef" id="n122.5src" href="#n122.5">430</a>. Slaves are equally kept by the Gajos, whose country borders on Atjeh<a class="noteRef" id="n122.6src" href="#n122.6">431</a>.
</p>
<p>Matthes gives some details on slavery among the Makassars and Bugis of South Celebes<a class="noteRef" id="n122.7src" href="#n122.7">432</a>.
</p>
<p>In Tidore slavery formerly existed, many slaves being procured from New Guinea<a class="noteRef" id="n122.8src" href="#n122.8">433</a>. It has, however, been abolished by the Dutch government<a class="noteRef" id="n122.9src" href="#n122.9">434</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the Moros of Mindanao “slavery is such an established custom and institution
of the land that it is generally sanctioned and supported in the Luwaran [laws]”<a class="noteRef" id="n123.1src" href="#n123.1">435</a>.

<p class="first">Some tribes of this group undoubtedly have slaves. These are the Kakhyens<a class="noteRef" id="n123.2src" href="#n123.2">436</a>, the Shans of Zimmé<a class="noteRef" id="n123.3src" href="#n123.3">437</a>, the Lawas and the Hill-tribes of North Aracan<a class="noteRef" id="n123.4src" href="#n123.4">438</a>, one of these hill-tribes being the Khyoungtha of Chittagong<a class="noteRef" id="n123.5src" href="#n123.5">439</a>.
</p>
<p>The Lethtas have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n123.6src" href="#n123.6">440</a>.
</p>
<p>The Steins, according to Colquhoun, sometimes seize a slave in order to sacrifice
him<a class="noteRef" id="n123.7src" href="#n123.7">441</a>. No more particulars being given, we cannot make out whether the word slave is used
here in its true sense, or means a captive taken to be sacrificed.
</p>
<p>Mason remarks on the Karens: “In war they kill without regard to age or sex.… The
head of the war keeps the captives a considerable time, when, if none of their friends
come to redeem them, he sells them off to other districts for oxen or buffaloes if
practicable, that he may have an ox or a buffalo to give to each village that came
to his aid”<a class="noteRef" id="n123.8src" href="#n123.8">442</a>. So the Karens seem to prefer oxen and buffaloes to captives. There are, however,
many debtor-slaves among the Karen-Nees<a class="noteRef" id="n123.9src" href="#n123.9">443</a>. They are also noted for their kidnapping propensities; but it seems that the kidnapped
are only intended for sale abroad<a class="noteRef" id="n123.10src" href="#n123.10">444</a>. At any rate there are debtor-slaves, and so slavery exists.
</p>
<p>Wehrli, in his study on the Chingpaws (Sing-Phos or Kachins) of Upper Burma, gives
many details, which sufficiently prove that slavery exists, or till recently existed
among them<a class="noteRef" id="n123.11src" href="#n123.11">445</a>.
</p>
<p>We may add here the inhabitants of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal.
</p>
<p>Although Man does not explicitly state that the Andamanese have no slaves, his elaborate
account of their social life sufficiently <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>proves that they are unacquainted with slavery. Social status is dependent on relationship,
on skill in hunting, fishing etc., and on a reputation for generosity and hospitality.
A child captured in war “would meet with kindly treatment, in the hope of his or her
being induced ultimately to become a member of the captor’s tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n124.1src" href="#n124.1">446</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>Of the Nicobarese Svoboda says: “All writers agree that nowhere in these islands is
there subordination, all inhabitants being of the same rank. Only older and more experienced
people have somewhat more influence than the rest”<a class="noteRef" id="n124.2src" href="#n124.2">447</a>. Hence we may infer that slavery does not exist.

<p class="first">Several authors state that the Meshmees have slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n124.3src" href="#n124.3">448</a>.
</p>
<p>The Hill-tribes near Rajamahall have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n124.4src" href="#n124.4">449</a>.
</p>
<p>Dalton gives several particulars about slavery among the Garos. Eliot also affirms
that they have slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n124.5src" href="#n124.5">450</a>.
</p>
<p>The Kookies, according to Macrae, “at times … make captives of the children, and often
adopt them into their families, when they have none of their own; and the only slaves
among them are the captives thus taken”<a class="noteRef" id="n124.6src" href="#n124.6">451</a>. What our informant means is not quite clear. The children who have been adopted
certainly are not slaves. Perhaps a part only of the captured <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>children are adopted, the rest constituting the slave-class of the Kookies; but this
is not clearly stated. Lewin asserts that all the hill-tribes (Toungtha, divided into
Lhoosai, Tipperah and Kookies) formerly had debtor-slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n125.1src" href="#n125.1">452</a>; but as none of our other authorities make any mention of this, we doubt whether
this general remark applies to the Kookies, the more so as, according to Macrae, “the
only slaves among them are the captives”. So it becomes very doubtful whether the
Kookies have slaves. Dalton’s statement that “all the enemies he [the Kookie] has
killed will be in the happy hunting-fields in attendance on him as slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n125.2src" href="#n125.2">453</a> is not sufficient to decide the question. One thing only is certain: the Rajah has
slaves. According to Dalton, murderers and thieves become slaves of the Rajah. Stewart
affirms the same of those guilty of theft, burglary or arson, and Butler of thieves<a class="noteRef" id="n125.3src" href="#n125.3">454</a>. But if only the Rajah, who represents the public power, has slaves, the Kookies
are not properly to be called a slave-keeping people. Whether there are other slaves,
besides those of the Rajah, is not sufficiently clear.
</p>
<p>The Todas very probably have no slaves. Neither Metz, nor the writers quoted by Spencer,
make any mention of slavery, though they fully describe their social life<a class="noteRef" id="n125.4src" href="#n125.4">455</a>.
</p>
<p>The Santals also very probably are unacquainted with slavery. According to Hunter
“caste is unknown among the Santals”. “The classification of the Santals depended
not upon social rank or occupation, but upon the family basis.” Dalton, describing
the Santals, does not speak of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n125.5src" href="#n125.5">456</a>.
</p>
<p>The Khonds formerly offered human sacrifices. The victims were purchased, and often
kept for many years before being sacrificed. Our informant adds: “I may just allude
here to another class of persons who are purchased by the Khonds, or procured by them
for adoption into their families as helps in household affairs, and in field labours.
These are called Possia Poes, and are usually obtained when young. They run little
or no risk of being sacrificed, and very often marry into the families of their purchasers,
and in the course of time merge <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>into the general population.” In another passage these Possia Poes are called serfs:
“These serfs are well treated, and in no immediate danger; but there is always a remote
probability of their sacrifice”<a class="noteRef" id="n126.1src" href="#n126.1">457</a>. As it is stated that these Possia Poes are absorbed into the general population,
we may safely conclude that they are not slaves.
</p>
<p>The Lushais, according to Dalton, enslave women and children<a class="noteRef" id="n126.2src" href="#n126.2">458</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Manipuris Dalton says that “slavery is an institution amongst them”, and he
gives some details besides. So we need not doubt its existence, though Watt makes
no mention of it<a class="noteRef" id="n126.3src" href="#n126.3">459</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Jyntias and Kasias the Rajah has slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n126.4src" href="#n126.4">460</a>. Whether there are any other slaves does not appear.
</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as slavery among the Oraons”, according to Dalton<a class="noteRef" id="n126.5src" href="#n126.5">461</a>.
</p>
<p>The Korwas also very probably have no slaves. In their raids they kill all they meet<a class="noteRef" id="n126.6src" href="#n126.6">462</a>.
</p>
<p>The Kafirs have slaves, according to several writers<a class="noteRef" id="n126.7src" href="#n126.7">463</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Padam Abors slavery undoubtedly exists<a class="noteRef" id="n126.8src" href="#n126.8">464</a>.
</p>
<p>Dalton says of the Dophlas: “They have normally the same Mongolian type of physiognomy,
but from their intercourse with the people of the plains and the number of <span class="corr" id="xd32e6907" title="Source: Asamese">Assamese</span> slaves, which they have by fair means or foul acquired, it is much modified and softened”<a class="noteRef" id="n126.9src" href="#n126.9">465</a>. Nothing more is added about slavery. Perhaps these “slaves” are simply captured
women, no other slaves being ever taken. Whether slavery really exists is not clear.
</p>
<p>The Nagas keep slaves, if we are to believe Grange who “saw many Muneeporees who had
been thus seized whilst young, and sold both amongst Kookies, Cacharees and Nagas”.
“The children of slaves are slaves.” Miss Godden remarks: “Slavery was unknown among
one or more tribes [of the Nagas] according <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>to Dr. Brown.” “Among the Aos [one of the Naga tribes] it is said to have been universal”<a class="noteRef" id="n127.1src" href="#n127.1">466</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Bodo and Dhimals “there are neither servants nor slaves, nor aliens of any
kind”<a class="noteRef" id="n127.2src" href="#n127.2">467</a>.
</p>
<p>The Veddahs of Ceylon, according to Sarasin, are unacquainted with slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n127.3src" href="#n127.3">468</a>.

<p class="first">The Kazak Kirghiz, according to Pallas, “much preferred the securing of a slave to
the killing of a man. They did not treat their slaves cruelly, as long as the latter
behaved well”. But the information we get from other sources shows that they were
not a slave-keeping people. Boutakoff says nothing about slavery. According to Ujfalvy
the poor serve the rich; he calls this a real serfdom. But he adds that, if the poor
do not wish to serve, they must borrow from the rich at 100 per cent. <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>interest. So these poor are compelled to serve by hunger, not by any social rule.
Chambers says: “They … have well earned for themselves the title of the “Slavehunters
of the Steppes” by seizing upon caravans, appropriating the goods, and selling their
captives at the great slave-markets at Khiva, Bokhara, etc. Their wealth consists
of cattle, sheep, horses, and camels”<a class="noteRef" id="n128.1src" href="#n128.1">469</a>. This is clear: the captives are sold abroad, and do not serve as slaves among the
Kirghiz themselves; therefore they are not enumerated as forming part of their wealth.
The best describer of the Kazak Kirghiz that we know of, Levchine, agrees with Chambers.
“Slavery is unknown among them.” “The Turks, the Persians, and nearly all other sectaries
of Mohammed keep slaves.… The Kirghiz, on the contrary, have no slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n128.2src" href="#n128.2">470</a>. In several passages of his book, however, he makes mention of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n128.3src" href="#n128.3">471</a>. But this will be understood, if we pay attention to two other statements of his.
“They do not kill their prisoners, but sell them to the Bokharians, Khivians, and
other neighbouring nations.” They buy many commodities from their neighbours, and
“in exchange … provide them with slaves captured on the Russian frontiers”<a class="noteRef" id="n128.4src" href="#n128.4">472</a>. So the Kirghiz in Levchine’s time made slaves; they did not, however, themselves
employ them; they were only slave-traders and not a slave-keeping people. Radloff,
who many years after Levchine visited the Kazak Kirghiz, supposes that they formerly
kept slaves. He says: “The former serfs and slaves of the sultan, who have been for
many decades emancipated, always try still to nomadize in the vicinity of the sultans,
and, though at present entirely on a level with the other Kirghiz, are still called
<i>telenguts</i>” “The denominations <i>kul</i> (male slave) and <i>küng</i> (female slave) now mean male and female servant”<a class="noteRef" id="n128.5src" href="#n128.5">473</a>. But we may compare this with a statement of Levchine’s: “We do not arrange in a
separate class the <i>telenguts</i> or servants of the khans, nor the <i>kuls</i> or slaves. The former are taken from among the Kirghiz and enjoy the same rights;
the latter are looked upon as personal property or commodities and are not Kirghiz.
They are <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>Russian, Persian, Kalmuck, etc. prisoners”<a class="noteRef" id="n129.1src" href="#n129.1">474</a>. We see that Radloff’s “serfs or slaves”, the <i>telenguts</i>, were not slaves, and the <i>kuls</i> were captured slaves intended to be sold. Our inference is that the Kazak Kirghiz
in their former independent state did not keep slaves.
</p>
<p>About the Kara Kirghiz we have got but little information. Radloff, in a short article
on them, says: “In the regions of their winter-quarters (on the Issik-köl) they cultivate
very large pieces of land, on which they leave behind labourers or slaves (of whom
there are but few) whilst the tribe repairs <i>en masse</i> to the western mountains. These labourers get no wages, but a part of the produce
in kind”<a class="noteRef" id="n129.2src" href="#n129.2">475</a>. Although this receiving of a part of the produce is not incompatible with slavery,
their being left behind without any supervision, and Radloff’s calling them labourers
or slaves and in the latter sentence labourers only, makes us doubt whether these
people are really slaves, the more so as in his book slavery among the Kara Kirghiz
is not mentioned<a class="noteRef" id="n129.3src" href="#n129.3">476</a>.
</p>
<p>Koehne, in his article on Kalmuck law, referring to Pallas and Bergmann, asserts that
the Kalmucks had slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n129.4src" href="#n129.4">477</a>. But the particulars he gives are not sufficient for us to decide, whether the so-called
slaves were slaves proper or retainers of the chiefs; and if slaves, whether they
were employed by the Kalmucks, or intended for sale abroad. Spencer refers to a statement
of Pallas’ (but from which of his books does not appear), according to which slavery
was inflicted as a punishment<a class="noteRef" id="n129.5src" href="#n129.5">478</a>; but whether the person so punished was kept as a slave among the Kalmucks or sold
abroad, we are not told. The only book of Pallas’ to which we have access does not
throw much light on the subject. “Adultery and fornication” he says “which are voluntarily
[?] committed with female slaves … are liable to punishment”. In another place he
states that the Torguts (a division of the Kalmucks) had much changed in physical
appearance, probably by their intercourse with females captured abroad. As a punishment
for some offences <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>the culprit lost one or more of his children; but what was done with these children
does not appear<a class="noteRef" id="n130.1src" href="#n130.1">479</a>. Nothing more definite on slavery is found is his detailed description of the Kalmucks.
In an article on the Kalmucks of the Black Irtysch Valley we read: “Horrible is the
state of the unfortunate people who are reduced to slavery; they are bartered and
sold like cattle”<a class="noteRef" id="n130.2src" href="#n130.2">480</a>. Here probably slaves intended for sale abroad are meant; for such horrible treatment
of slaves is more common with slave-dealers than with those who employ slaves. Radloff
has nothing on slavery; but his description of the Kalmucks is too short to draw any
inference from<a class="noteRef" id="n130.3src" href="#n130.3">481</a>. So we are left in doubt as to the existence of slavery, though we are inclined to
think that it does not exist.
</p>
<p>Much more fully than the Kalmucks proper Radloff describes the Altaians or Altaian
Mountain-Kalmucks. Slaves not being mentioned, and it being stated in many places
that the menial work is done by servants and by the poor who are fed by the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n130.4src" href="#n130.4">482</a>, it is certain that slavery does not exist. The word “slave” occurs in one place
only, viz. in the mourning-song of the widow, who complains that “now she wears a
leathern dress like base slaves; now she eats coarse food like slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n130.5src" href="#n130.5">483</a>. If we have not here to deal with an inaccurate translation, this mourning-song might
be a reminiscence of formerly existing slavery. Slavery would then have disappeared
spontaneously, not through Russian influence, for the Altaians have maintained their
position in the mountain-valleys of the South-west Altai, least accessible to Russian
colonization. So we may safely consider the Altaians as a savage tribe keeping no
slaves.
</p>
<p>Radloff’s notes on the Teleuts, Tatars on the Kondoma and Abakan Tatars are too short
to draw any safe inference from<a class="noteRef" id="n130.6src" href="#n130.6">484</a>.
</p>
<p>Many Central Asiatic tribes have been described by Vambéry. The description of each
of them fills many pages, but the information we get about social facts is rather
incomplete. Therefore, though in most of his descriptions slavery is not <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>mentioned, we may not infer that it does not exist. The positive cases have of course
more value.
</p>
<p>The Usbegs, according to Vambéry, till their land aided by Persian slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n131.1src" href="#n131.1">485</a>. No more details being given, we may put this down as a positive case, though not
a clear one.
</p>
<p>The Kara Kalpaks, in the beginning of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, were given to slave-stealing<a class="noteRef" id="n131.2src" href="#n131.2">486</a>, whether for their own use or for sale does not appear.
</p>
<p>The Turkomans, according to Vambéry, sell foreigners as slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n131.3src" href="#n131.3">487</a>. In another book the same author tells us that in their internal wars they made slaves;
and he speaks of their keeping female slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n131.4src" href="#n131.4">488</a>. Stein and Weil make no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n131.5src" href="#n131.5">489</a>. Letourneau, referring to Burnes, remarks: “The Persian captives are for the Turkomans
a source of large profit; but the captors do not as a rule keep them for themselves,
except sometimes the women, of whom they make concubines or wives”<a class="noteRef" id="n131.6src" href="#n131.6">490</a>. So we may safely infer that slavery does not exist here.
</p>
<p>The Mongols have hired herdsmen who tend their camels<a class="noteRef" id="n131.7src" href="#n131.7">491</a>. Whether they have any slaves does not appear.
</p>
<p>Ujfalvy informs us that among the Tadjiks of Hissar slavery was recently abolished
by an order from Bokhara<a class="noteRef" id="n131.8src" href="#n131.8">492</a>.
</p>
<p>According to the same writer “all Galtchas are free; for slavery does not exist and
has never existed in their inaccessible valleys”<a class="noteRef" id="n131.9src" href="#n131.9">493</a>.
</p>
<p>The Kurds of Eriwan probably have no slaves. They keep hired herdsmen. All members
of the community, rich and poor, enjoy the same rights<a class="noteRef" id="n131.10src" href="#n131.10">494</a>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Pallas in the 18<sup>th</sup> century visited many Siberian tribes; but most of his notes are too short to draw
any inference from as to the existence of slavery.
</p>
<p>Of the Ostyaks he gives a detailed account. They probably had no slaves; for it is
stated that the chiefs, like the common people, had to live by their own labour<a class="noteRef" id="n132.1src" href="#n132.1">495</a>. But in Pallas’ time they were already entirely under Russian control<a class="noteRef" id="n132.2src" href="#n132.2">496</a>, so it is not certain that in their aboriginal state they had no slaves.
</p>
<p>The Samoyedes were not nearly so much under Russian influence. The details given by
Pallas make it nearly certain that slavery did not exist. “Every Samoyede keeps his
reindeer and tends them himself with the help of his family, except the richest, who
hire poor men as herdsmen”<a class="noteRef" id="n132.3src" href="#n132.3">497</a>. Islawin and Finsch also make no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n132.4src" href="#n132.4">498</a>. And the account of Samoyede customs given by Von Stenin, who has largely drawn upon
Russian literature, makes the non-existence of slavery quite certain<a class="noteRef" id="n132.5src" href="#n132.5">499</a>.
</p>
<p>“The Ghiliaks” says Déniker in a valuable article “are all equal, and never have there
been slaves among them”<a class="noteRef" id="n132.6src" href="#n132.6">500</a>.
</p>
<p>Müller gives a somewhat minute description of the Tunguz, in which slavery is not
mentioned, so it very probably does not exist<a class="noteRef" id="n132.7src" href="#n132.7">501</a>.
</p>
<p>Sieroshevski, who lived more than 12 years among the Yakuts, concludes from their
traditions, that they formerly kept slaves. “In ancient times, the Yakuts had a name
for a man whom a <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>defeated hero gave to his conqueror as a compensation for sparing his own life. Such
persons later were in fact slaves and were included in the gifts with a bride. If
they were females, they became concubines of the master. Such a slave person was called
an <i>enne</i>, and this word has new come to be used as an adjective for whatever is given with
a bride”. However this may be, it appears from his detailed and excellent description,
that now they have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n133.1src" href="#n133.1">502</a>.
</p>
<p>Laufer, describing the Gold of that part of the Amoor lying between Chabarovsk and
Sophisk, makes no mention of slavery. But as their whole mode of life is strongly
influenced by the Russians, we are not certain whether in their aboriginal state they
kept slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n133.2src" href="#n133.2">503</a>.
</p>
<p>Steller’s statements about slavery among the Italmen or Kamchadales are not very clear.
Speaking of their wars he says: “The victorious party enslaved the prisoners, made
the women and girls concubines, and slaughtered all males they could to be henceforward
safe from them.” In another place he states: “They do not steal anything from each
other but women and dogs, which was the cause of their former wars.” In his survey
of Kamchadale history he speaks of a chief who, in order to augment his power, exacted
from his enemies a tribute of girls and boys. The Italmen of the Kurile Islands attacked
those of the Kamchadale peninsula, and carried off many girls and boys into servitude.
In a note he states: “The prisoners and slaves were employed in various rough and
domestic labours.… If a prisoner behaved well, he was sometimes dismissed to his home
after a two or three years’ imprisonment”<a class="noteRef" id="n133.3src" href="#n133.3">504</a>. In his chapters on male and female labour and on marriage he makes no mention of
slaves. In Steller’s time Kamchatka had already been brought under Russian control;
so he could not any more observe their warfare and taking of prisoners, but got his
information about these matters from hearsay. This probably is the reason why this
information is not more clear. As he gives some particulars about slaves kept by the
Italmen of the Kurile Islands, we may suppose that these at least had slaves. The
author of the “Histoire de Kamtschatka”, <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>who consulted Steller’s manuscript, says: “The end of their wars was to take prisoners
in order to make the men work and to take the women as concubines”<a class="noteRef" id="n134.1src" href="#n134.1">505</a>. But he adds no details.
</p>
<p>The Tuski or Chukchi are to be divided into the inland Tuski, who keep reindeer, and
the Tuski of the coast, who are fishers. Nordenskiöld remarks: “According to some
Russian authors there are slaves, undoubtedly descendants of war-captives, on the
inland settlements. Amongst the natives of the coast, on the contrary, the most perfect
equality prevails”<a class="noteRef" id="n134.2src" href="#n134.2">506</a>. A statement of Wrangell’s, referred to by Erman, gives some more particulars. Wrangell,
having lived already some time with the Tuski, perceived to his great amazement that
there were serfs (<i lang="de">Leibeigenen</i>); he saw some families that did menial work; they had no property, and were not allowed
to go away from the rich on whom they were dependent. They received clothing and lodging
from their employers, and did the hardest work; for instance they ran by the side
of the sledges to urge on the dogs. The Tuski said that this state of things had always
existed. Wrangell supposes that these serfs were the offspring of war-captives. It
does not appear what this supposition is founded upon<a class="noteRef" id="n134.3src" href="#n134.3">507</a>. This record is worth more than Nordenskiöld’s vague reference to “some Russian authors.”
But it is not easy to decide whether these subjected people are slaves. They might
simply be poor men dependent on the rich without being slaves, such as are also found
among the Eskimos. But the fact, that the poor Tuski are obliged to stay with their
employers is more suggestive of slavery. Georgi however states that among the Tuski
the poor serve the rich as herdsmen; and Dall, Hooper, and Kennan make no mention
of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n134.4src" href="#n134.4">508</a>. In the “<span lang="fr">Histoire de Kamtschatka</span>” it is stated that they made raids on the tribes subjected to Russia, “killing or
taking prisoners all they meet”<a class="noteRef" id="n134.5src" href="#n134.5">509</a>. But we are not told what was the fate of these captives. So we must leave this question
undecided. At any rate this alleged slavery has been useful; for it led to Nordenskiöld’s
positive <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>statement that among the Tuski of the coast, whom he had visited himself, slavery
was unknown.
</p>
<p>The Koryakes are to be divided into nomadic Koryakes and settled Koryakes. The former
with their herds roam from one place to another, the latter live along the rivers.
The languages of these two divisions differ so much, that they cannot understand each
other. “The nomadic Koryakes consider them [the settled Koryakes] as slaves, and treat
them accordingly” says our informant. But we know that such slavery of a tribe as
a whole is not slavery in the true sense of the word. No other mention is made of
slaves. The nomadic Koryakes “before they were subjected by the Russians, had neither
government nor magistrates; only the rich exercized some authority over the poor”<a class="noteRef" id="n135.1src" href="#n135.1">510</a>. So we may infer that slavery is unknown among both nomadic and settled Koryakes.
</p>
<p>Melnikow, minutely describing the Buriats, makes no mention of slaves; but as they
have been long under Russian influence<a class="noteRef" id="n135.2src" href="#n135.2">511</a>, we are not certain whether slavery was not formerly an institution among them.
</p>
<p>The Ainu, though not inhabiting Siberia, may find a place here, as they live nearer
to this than to any other group. Batchelor, describing the raids which the several
divisions of the Ainu made on each other, says: “On such occasions the whole of the
male population were murdered during sleep, whilst the women and children were carried
off as slaves to work in the gardens, and were called <i>usshui ne guru</i>. The women however were kept as concubines”<a class="noteRef" id="n135.3src" href="#n135.3">512</a>. Landor refers to this and some other remarks of Batchelor’s and then adds: “From
my own experience—and I may add I am the only foreigner who has seen these Tokachi,
or as others call them, Tokapchi Ainu—I came to a conclusion very different from this.
I found that not only were they not cannibals, but that, taken altogether, they were
the most peaceable, gentle, and kind Ainu I came across during my peregrinations through
the land of the hairy people”<a class="noteRef" id="n135.4src" href="#n135.4">513</a>. Hitchcock also describes the Ainu as peaceable. Speaking of some cruel punishments
in vogue amongst them, he remarks: “H. von Siebold has supposed from <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>these old customs, that the Ainos were once a savage and warlike people. They may
have been so, as one might infer from Japanese tradition, but it seems to me unsafe
to make the assumption on the grounds suggested by von Siebold. Their present character
does not sustain it in any way”<a class="noteRef" id="n136.1src" href="#n136.1">514</a>. Some other describers of the Ainu we have consulted make no mention at all of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n136.2src" href="#n136.2">515</a>. So we cannot arrive at a definite conclusion.

<p class="first">Slavery undoubtedly exists among the Ossetes<a class="noteRef" id="n136.3src" href="#n136.3">516</a> and Circassians<a class="noteRef" id="n136.4src" href="#n136.4">517</a>.
</p>
<p>The Shahsewenses, according to Radde, consist of two social classes, the nobles and
the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n136.5src" href="#n136.5">518</a>. So they probably have no slaves.
</p>
<p>According to Bodenstedt “every Suane who is not able to provide for his daughters
and sisters, may sell them as slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n136.6src" href="#n136.6">519</a>. This is the only reference made to slavery by any of our informants<a class="noteRef" id="n136.7src" href="#n136.7">520</a>. Telfer states that the independent Suanes <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>acknowledge neither king nor nobility, consider all men equal, despise all authority
and have no laws<a class="noteRef" id="n137.1src" href="#n137.1">521</a>. Therefore it does not seem probable that they keep slaves; perhaps the daughters
and sisters of whom Bodenstedt speaks are sold abroad.
</p>
<p>In Klaproth’s detailed description of the Charachai no mention is made of slavery;
so probably it does not exist<a class="noteRef" id="n137.2src" href="#n137.2">522</a>.
</p>
<p>Chantre gives a few short notes on some Caucasus tribes. Gourien nobles, according
to him, export slaves to Turkey<a class="noteRef" id="n137.3src" href="#n137.3">523</a>. Whether they also employ slaves, we do not know.
</p>
<p>Among the Kabards of Asia Minor the families consist of about twelve persons, slaves
included<a class="noteRef" id="n137.4src" href="#n137.4">524</a>.
</p>
<p>The Abchases were formerly slave-traders. They coupled their prisoners, and sold the
children born of these unions<a class="noteRef" id="n137.5src" href="#n137.5">525</a>. Whether these slave-breeders kept their slaves only for the sake of reproduction
or for anything beyond this, does not appear.
</p>
<p>The Tchetchenes “say: We are all equal. There were never slaves among them. Only the
captives were not members of the tribe; but even these often married their master’s
daughters and so became their equals”<a class="noteRef" id="n137.6src" href="#n137.6">526</a>. These captives bear a strong resemblance to slaves; and we should be very much inclined
to call them such, were it not that Chantre positively asserts that there never were
slaves in this tribe. The lack of further details prevents our coming to any definite
conclusion.

<p class="first">Tromp and Macdonald, describing the Caffres in general, make no mention of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n138.5src" href="#n138.5">531</a>. Waitz remarks: “The poor join the rich as their “children”, live in servitude, and
are often exposed to heavy oppression and <span class="corr" id="xd32e7700" title="Source: arbitary">arbitrary</span> treatment; but they are not slaves in the true sense: slavery proper does not exist.”
“The conquered are not enslaved, the conqueror requires only subjection; whereas often
the object of their wars is the capturing of cattle rather than of men”<a class="noteRef" id="n138.6src" href="#n138.6">532</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Ama-Xosa are described by Fritsch. War is seldom sanguinary, its main object being
cattle-stealing; but if the attacked defend their cattle energetically, a general
slaughter ensues; women and children are killed without discrimination. Fugitive enemies
are mercilessly slaughtered. When a chief has great renown, he gets many followers,
who crowd towards him from all sides and contribute to the enlargement of his power;
for it is a custom among the Caffres never to deliver up a fugitive whatever the reason
of his fleeing from his native country. The chiefs punish insurgents by taking away
their cattle; then they are poor men without any influence in the tribe. These particulars
make the existence of slavery improbable: no prisoners are taken, fugitives and insurgents
are not enslaved. In one place, however, Fritsch speaks of slaves. The Fengu, remnants
of destroyed tribes, fell into the hands of the Ama-Xosa, who spared the lives of
these fugitives, but kept them in wretched bondage. “In 1835, after this slave-state
had lasted for more than ten years, when the Caffres were at war with the colony,
the Fengu begged the Governor Sir Benjamin d’Urban to liberate them. The Governor,
complying with the request, sent troops to enable them to depart, and so at once 16800
men, women and children with what little cattle and other property they had, established
themselves in the colony”<a class="noteRef" id="n139.1src" href="#n139.1">533</a>. It is clear that these Fengu were not slaves. That they could depart in such large
numbers from the country of the Ama-Xosa, proves that they lived more or less separate.
They were weaker tribes subjected by a stronger one; we shall see that this occurs
very often in South Africa. The tribes were subjected as tribes, not the individuals
as such; therefore they were not slaves. Kropf, who lived among the Ama-Xosa as a
missionary for 42 years, describes them as they were some 70 years ago. In his detailed
account he does not speak of slaves. Male prisoners were killed, women and children
were sometimes left alive. We are not told what was the fate of these women and children.
There were no social classes, the whole people, from the chief down to the last of
his subjects, regarding themselves as one family<a class="noteRef" id="n139.2src" href="#n139.2">534</a>. From all this we may safely infer that slavery did not exist among the Ama-Xosa.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>In his description of the Ama-Zulu Fritsch makes no mention of slavery. Livingstone
says: “Zulus do not usually destroy any save the old, and able-bodied men. The object
of their raids in general is that the captured women and children may be embodied
into the tribe, and become Zulus. The masters of the captives are kind to them, and
children are put on the same level as those of any ordinary man. In their usual plan,
we seem to have the condition so bepraised by some advocates for slavery. The members
of small disunited communities are taken under a powerful government, obtain kind
masters, whom they are allowed to exchange for any one else within the tribe, and
their children become freemen.… The Zulus are said never to sell their captives”<a class="noteRef" id="n140.1src" href="#n140.1">535</a>. These captives who are “embodied into the tribe, and become Zulus,” and are never
sold, certainly are not slaves.
</p>
<p>The Matabele are a division of the Zulus, who in 1820 separated from the mother-country.
Their mode of life still bears much resemblance to that of the Zulus<a class="noteRef" id="n140.2src" href="#n140.2">536</a>. Livingstone remarks: “Among the coast tribes a fugitive is almost always sold, but
here [<i>i.e.</i> among the Zulus] a man retains the same rank he held in his own tribe. The children
of captives even have the same privileges as the children of their captors.<span class="corr" id="xd32e7728" title="Not in source">”</span> The Rev. T.&nbsp;M. Thomas, a missionary now living with Moselekatse, finds the same system
prevailing among his Zulu or Matabele. He says that “the African slave, brought by
a foray to the tribe, enjoys, from the beginning, the privileges and name of a child
and looks upon his master and mistress in every respect as his new parents. He is
not only nearly his master’s equal, but he may, with impunity, leave his master and
go wherever he likes within the boundary of the kingdom: although a bondman or servant,
his position, especially in Moselekatse’s country, does not convey the true idea of
a state of slavery; for, by care and diligence, he may soon become a master himself,
and even more rich and powerful than he who led him captive.” The practice pursued
by these people, on returning from a foray, of selling the captives to each other
for corn or cattle, might lead one to imagine, that slavery existed in all its intensity
among the <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>native Africans; but Mr. Thomas, observing, as we have often done, the actual working
of the system, says very truly: “Neither the punctuality, quickness, thoroughness,
nor amount of exertion is required by the African as by the European master. In Europe
the difficulty is want of time, in Africa, what is to be done with it. Apart from
the shocking waste of life, which takes place in these and all slave forays, their
slavery is not so repulsive as it always becomes in European hands”<a class="noteRef" id="n141.1src" href="#n141.1">537</a>. Kerr states, that the masters must pay for the offences committed by their slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n141.2src" href="#n141.2">538</a>. Holub’s account throws quite another light on the subject. The captured boys are
given to warriors in order to be instructed by them in warfare; those already accustomed
to the use of weapons are instantly enrolled into the army. Female captives are lent
to warriors. The king used yearly to make raids on the neighbouring countries; on
these occasions thousands were slaughtered. Besides the men, old women no longer able
to work, infants and young children were killed. When Mackenzie in 1863 visited Matabeleland,
he found but a few Zulu-warriors. Most men in the prime of life were Bechuanas, whom
the king had either captured or exacted as a tax. The regiments of young men consisted
mainly of Makalaka and Mashona youths. In time of peace they had to tend the cattle,
and on their return home to exercise themselves in the use of weapons<a class="noteRef" id="n141.3src" href="#n141.3">539</a>. Can these statements be brought to agree? It may be, that Holub’s account relates
to a period of strong but short-lived despotism, such as so often occurs among these
tribes, and Livingstone’s description to a more peaceful time. It may also be, that
both relate to the same period, Livingstone not mentioning their military organization.
Though Thomas (quoted by Livingstone) speaks of slaves, it is not easy to make out,
whether the captives were really slaves; we should rather think not, as they were
allowed to leave their masters and go wherever they liked. At any rate slavery, if
it exists, is not much developed, the chief function of slaves probably being reinforcement
of the tribe in warfare.
</p>
<p>The Bechuana group consists of several tribes, the principal being, according to Schurtz<a class="noteRef" id="n141.4src" href="#n141.4">540</a>, the Basuto, the Makololo, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>Bamangwato, the Bakwains and the Bakalahari. Fritsch, describing the Bechuanas in
general, makes no mention of slaves. According to Holub, however, they have Makalahiri
slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n142.1src" href="#n142.1">541</a>. But from some particulars it appears that these Makalahiri are rather a tribe subjected
as a whole than individual slaves. “These Makalahiri have to live in the more western
parts, where game is plentiful, and have to kill the game and bring the spoil to their
masters, who live in parts where the water is more abundant.” They are employed as
hunters or herdsmen. “If a Makalahiri servant behaves well and kills a good many ostriches
for his master, he is allowed to marry a Bechuana woman”<a class="noteRef" id="n142.2src" href="#n142.2">542</a>. Conder describes the Makalahiri as “nomadic hunters, living chiefly in the west,
and considered in the light of serfs of the chief”<a class="noteRef" id="n142.3src" href="#n142.3">543</a>. It is clear that these hunters, living away from the Bechuanas, and considered as
“serfs of the chiefs,” are a subjected tribe and not individual slaves. There are
two other tribes subjected to the Bechuanas: the Barwa or Masarwa, and the Madenassana.
That these are servile tribes and not slaves, appears still more clearly than with
the Makalahiri<a class="noteRef" id="n142.4src" href="#n142.4">544</a>. Hence we should infer that the Bechuanas have no slaves. We shall presently see
whether this conclusion agrees with the information we get about the single tribes
belonging to this group.
</p>
<p>According to Casalis, who was intimately acquainted with the Basutos, slavery was
<span class="corr" id="xd32e7776" title="Source: unkwown">unknown</span> among them, the servile work being performed by the women and children. Prisoners
of war were admitted to be ransomed<a class="noteRef" id="n142.5src" href="#n142.5">545</a>.
</p>
<p>The Batauana are described by Passarge. Though he calls them a division of the Basutos,
the state of things among them, as regards slavery, is quite different from that among
the Basutos. Passarge speaks of slaves kept by them and also of tribes subjected by
them, but living in separate settlements and leading a tribal life. Whether the so-called
slaves are identical with the members of the subjected tribes or whether they are
slaves in the proper sense, is not clear<a class="noteRef" id="n142.6src" href="#n142.6">546</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>Livingstone tells us that the Makololo never make slaves. In another work he relates,
how once a troop of Matabele was starving on an island; the Makololo finding them
killed the adult people and adopted the rest. Formerly there was no slave-trade; now
captured children are the object of it<a class="noteRef" id="n143.1src" href="#n143.1">547</a>. The Makololo therefore have no slaves.
</p>
<p>As to the Bakwains, Livingstone speaks of a woman who, as a punishment for theft,
became the property of the injured party<a class="noteRef" id="n143.2src" href="#n143.2">548</a>. But we do not know, whether she was intended to be sold abroad or to be kept as
a slave. Holub speaks of Barwa and Makalahiri in a servile condition; but these are
probably subjected tribes and not slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n143.3src" href="#n143.3">549</a>.
</p>
<p>Joest informs us that among the Barolong there are descendants of slaves, though not
treated as such, who live with most of their families. They tend the cattle; their
name “Bakhalahari” vouches for their western origin<a class="noteRef" id="n143.4src" href="#n143.4">550</a>. Perhaps they are a division of the same Makalahiri we have met with as a tribe subjected
to the Bechuanas. But the statement that they live with Barolong families is more
suggestive of slavery; they may, however, be free labourers. We cannot arrive here
at any definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>The Angoni are great slave-traders, but also keep domestic slaves. Wiese and Kerr
give some particulars regarding their slave-system<a class="noteRef" id="n143.5src" href="#n143.5">551</a>.
</p>
<p>Junod gives a detailed description of the Baronga, living near Delagoa Bay. Slaves
were formerly sold on a large scale to the coast people. Whether the Baronga themselves
kept slaves does not appear<a class="noteRef" id="n143.6src" href="#n143.6">552</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Vawenda the children of sorcerers are sold as slaves; whether at home or
abroad we are not told<a class="noteRef" id="n143.7src" href="#n143.7">553</a>. No more particulars being given, we do not know whether slavery exists here.
</p>
<p>Theal, describing the Makalanga or Makaranga, tells us of a chief who offered female
slaves to the whites<a class="noteRef" id="n143.8src" href="#n143.8">554</a>. But this short note is by no means sufficient for us to go upon.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ovampo, according to Galton, have members of foreign tribes living among them
in a state of subjection; but whether these people are slaves in the true sense is
not clear. “I cannot speak with certainty” he says “of the exact standing in which
the Damaras and the Bushmen severally live among the Ovampo. The first are employed
principally as cattle-watchers; the second, who are even more ornamented than the
Ovampo themselves, are a kind of standing army; but I have great reason to doubt whether
either one or the other class is independent. The Ovampo, as I have mentioned, looked
down with much contempt on the Damaras; and there is not a single instance, so far
as I could learn, of any Ovampo woman marrying a Damara, and settling in Damaraland,
but the reverse is a very common case. The Bushmen appear to be naturalised among
the negro tribes, and free in the border-lands between them to a distance very far
north of Ondonga”<a class="noteRef" id="n144.1src" href="#n144.1">555</a>.
</p>
<p>Rautanen, in his description of the Ondonga, states that there are neither serfs nor
slaves. But at the same time he repeatedly makes mention of slaves. Slaves have no
rights of inheritance. The master is responsible for damages caused by his slaves.
Nobody but the chief has the right to sell slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n144.2src" href="#n144.2">556</a>. These contradictory statements do not allow us to arrive at a definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>The Ovaherero or Damaras, according to Andersson, have slaves. The men are lazy; all
their work is done by women and slaves. The slaves are the offspring of impoverished
families, and captured Bushmen. The former are enslaved when children and mainly employed
as herdsmen<a class="noteRef" id="n144.3src" href="#n144.3">557</a>. It is strange that Fritsch, who often refers to Andersson, makes no mention whatever
of slavery. Hahn and Haarhoff also have nothing on slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n144.4src" href="#n144.4">558</a>, which is very puzzling, as according to Andersson slavery holds so large a place
in their social life. Perhaps the children of impoverished families whom Andersson
speaks of <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>are not slaves but free labourers compelled to serve only by poverty; for “among all
South-African natives the rich oppress the poor, who in the hope of filling their
stomachs, submit to a state of dependence that is not authorized by law<a class="noteRef" id="n145.1src" href="#n145.1">559</a>”.
</p>
<p>Viehe remarks, that slavery in the proper sense does not exist among the Ovaherero.
But captive children are reared among them and regarded as making part of the low
domestics, so to speak as serfs. These serfs are, most of them, Damaras of the mountains.
They do the same kind of work as the Ovaherero. Many of them, when full-grown, acquire
wealth and are on a footing of equality with the Ovaherero themselves. “The serfs
live entirely without supervision and can at any time return to their free compatriots.”
The serfs, as well as the servants of Ovaherero origin, are designated by a native
name, originally meaning foreigner, but that has become to mean servant. In another
place our informant states, that every individual is called a servant, when compared
with a person of higher standing<a class="noteRef" id="n145.2src" href="#n145.2">560</a>.
</p>
<p>It is not easy to decide, whether this description is indicative of real slavery.
Only some of the captives, when full-grown, arrive at a position equal to that of
the free people; so it would seem that the others remain slaves. But if they are allowed
at any time to return to their own country, their position is a voluntary one.
</p>
<p>Kohler’s authorities, viz. the German magistrate Bensen and the missionaries Meyer
and Büttner, all affirm that the Ovaherero keep slaves and give several details. Slaves
are captives or children of such; but slavery can also take its origin in voluntary
submission. Most of the slaves are Damaras of the mountains. All the goods of the
slave belong to his master. The master is responsible for any crime committed by the
slave and has the right of life and death over him. Slaves are bought and sold and
inherited. They cannot be manumitted. Children of slaves are slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n145.3src" href="#n145.3">561</a>.
</p>
<p>From this it would appear that slavery really exists.
</p>
<p>The seeming contradiction between Viehe and Kohler’s authorities <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>might be solved, if we attend to the following remark, made by Kohler on Büttner’s
authority: “The practical possibility for the slaves of escaping from their master
is the best warrant for good treatment<a class="noteRef" id="n146.1src" href="#n146.1">562</a>.” We may infer from this that, when Viehe says that the slaves can at any time return
to their own country, it is only meant that it is easy from them to do so (as among
a pastoral and nomadic nation it is likely to be), not that they are permitted to
do so by law or custom.
</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the Ovaherero keep slaves.
</p>
<p>Among the Batoka the slave-trade had in Livingstone’s time been lately introduced<a class="noteRef" id="n146.2src" href="#n146.2">563</a>. We are not told whether they kept slaves themselves.
</p>
<p>The Barotse have slaves; this is proved by the statements of several writers<a class="noteRef" id="n146.3src" href="#n146.3">564</a>.
</p>
<p>In the descriptions of the Makalaka no mention is made of slavery, so they probably
have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n146.4src" href="#n146.4">565</a>.
</p>
<p>The Manansa are not fond of fighting<a class="noteRef" id="n146.5src" href="#n146.5">566</a>, so they probably make no prisoners. They might have purchased slaves; but as nothing
is told us of slavery amongst them, the probability is against this.
</p>
<p>The Kimbunda have an elaborate slave-system, minutely described by Magyar<a class="noteRef" id="n146.6src" href="#n146.6">567</a>.
</p>
<p>The Lovalé people have the reputation of being harsh task-masters. Slaves are procured
by exchange from abroad<a class="noteRef" id="n146.7src" href="#n146.7">568</a>. These short notes are all the evidence we know of, bearing on the existence of slavery
among them.
</p>
<p>The people of Lunda are great slave-traders. Several details given by our informants
prove that they also keep slaves for their own use<a class="noteRef" id="n146.8src" href="#n146.8">569</a>.
</p>
<p>In the neighbouring country of Cazembe there are two social classes: the nobility
and the Muzias or servants, including peasants, artisans, etc. Both classes are called
slaves of the Muata (king); this of course is not slavery proper. All men able to
fight must go to war; but this does not affect the <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>cultivation of the land, which is carried on by the women only<a class="noteRef" id="n147.1src" href="#n147.1">570</a>. These statements make the existence of slavery improbable.
</p>
<p>Among the Kioko slavery certainly exists<a class="noteRef" id="n147.2src" href="#n147.2">571</a>.
</p>
<p>The Selles, according to Magyar, have also slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n147.3src" href="#n147.3">572</a>.

<p>Among the Wanyaturu slavery is unknown<a class="noteRef" id="n148.8src" href="#n148.8">595</a>.
</p>
<p>Von Höhnel, visiting the country of the Wakikuyu, found two men, who some years before
had joined a caravan and had been left behind because they were ill; from that time
they had lived as slaves among the Wakikuyu<a class="noteRef" id="n148.9src" href="#n148.9">596</a>. This statement shows, that the Wakikuyu keep slaves for their own use, not for export
only.
</p>
<p>Of the Wawira we have a detailed description by Emin Pasha. As there is not a word
about slaves in it, it is almost certain that slavery does not exist among them<a class="noteRef" id="n148.10src" href="#n148.10">597</a>.
</p>
<p>Slavery is also very probably not to be found among the Wataveta, minutely described
by Thomson, Johnston and Von Höhnel<a class="noteRef" id="n148.11src" href="#n148.11">598</a>.

<p class="first">Ward and De Bas, speaking of the Congo tribes in general, state that slavery exists<a class="noteRef" id="n149.1src" href="#n149.1">599</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Lower Congo, according to Phillips, the family consists of “the head man or
patriarch, his wives, family proper, dependents and slaves.” There are also debtor-slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n149.2src" href="#n149.2">600</a>.

<p>Hoesemann gives several particulars about the slave system of some tribes of Cameroon,
the principal of which are the Indikki<a class="noteRef" id="n150.8src" href="#n150.8">625</a>.
</p>
<p>Regarding the Bakwiri, who are related to the Duallas, we are told that, unlike their
neighbours, they do not keep slaves. On the death of a king a slave is bought from
abroad and killed<a class="noteRef" id="n150.9src" href="#n150.9">626</a>.
</p>
<p>The describers of the Mundombe make no mention of slavery; so they probably have no
slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n150.10src" href="#n150.10">627</a>.
</p>
<p>The writers on the Quillengue also are silent on this subject; but here the descriptions
are not minute enough for us to arrive at any accurate conclusion<a class="noteRef" id="n150.11src" href="#n150.11">628</a>.
</p>
<p>The natives of Angola have slaves; whether for export only or also for their own use,
does not appear<a class="noteRef" id="n150.12src" href="#n150.12">629</a>.
</p>
<p>The same applies to the Bangala on the Kuango, who are great slave-traders<a class="noteRef" id="n150.13src" href="#n150.13">630</a>.
</p>
<p>The Songo or Masongo use slaves as articles of exchange, and wherever the chief goes,
he is accompanied by slaves; but whether they can rightly be called a slave-keeping
people, is not clear from Pogge’s short notes<a class="noteRef" id="n150.14src" href="#n150.14">631</a>.
</p>
<p>Several authors inform us that the Fans have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n150.15src" href="#n150.15">632</a>.
</p>
<p>In a monography on the Banaka and Bapuku many particulars <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>are given about their slave system<a class="noteRef" id="n151.1src" href="#n151.1">633</a>. Hence we infer that slavery exists among them, though Winwood Reade’s short remark
that among the Bapuka the men are equal would seem to point to a contrary conclusion<a class="noteRef" id="n151.2src" href="#n151.2">634</a>.
</p>
<p>Buchholz, in a short note, speaks of slavery among the Bakele<a class="noteRef" id="n151.3src" href="#n151.3">635</a>.
</p>
<p>The slave-trade is almost the only trade of the Okota. On the death of a distinguished
person slaves are killed<a class="noteRef" id="n151.4src" href="#n151.4">636</a>. This information is not, however, sufficient to put this case down as a clear one.
</p>
<p>None of our informants on the Bateke make any mention of slavery. According to Guiral
they sometimes eat their prisoners, when they find no occasion to sell them<a class="noteRef" id="n151.5src" href="#n151.5">637</a>. So they probably keep no slaves.
</p>
<p>The Wagenia are stated to throw the corpses of slaves, and perhaps of all the dead,
into the river<a class="noteRef" id="n151.6src" href="#n151.6">638</a>. This short note being the only evidence, we are not certain that slavery really
exists.
</p>
<p>Among the Warua at the funeral of a chief slaves are killed<a class="noteRef" id="n151.7src" href="#n151.7">639</a>. But this does not prove that slavery is a social institution here.
</p>
<p>The Bakuba have slaves, according to Wissmann<a class="noteRef" id="n151.8src" href="#n151.8">640</a>. But the same author states in another place, that male slaves are bought only to
be killed at funerals<a class="noteRef" id="n151.9src" href="#n151.9">641</a>. So slavery proper probably does not exist.
</p>
<p>When Wissmann visited the Tuchilangue, they had no male slaves; but on a later visit
he found that male slaves had been introduced among them. Pogge also observed male
slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n151.10src" href="#n151.10">642</a>. So at present slavery exists here.
</p>
<p>Of the Tupende we are told, that slaves have for two hundred years been exported from
their country. They buy female slaves, and make them their wives<a class="noteRef" id="n151.11src" href="#n151.11">643</a>. Probably they keep no male slaves; but it is not certain.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Aduma and Oschebo are slave-traders; but of domestic slavery no mention is made<a class="noteRef" id="n152.1src" href="#n152.1">644</a>.
</p>
<p>The same applies to the Hollo<a class="noteRef" id="n152.2src" href="#n152.2">645</a> and Milembue<a class="noteRef" id="n152.3src" href="#n152.3">646</a>.

<p>Among the Ibo or Eboe in the hinterland of the Niger delta criminals are sold abroad
as slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n156.7src" href="#n156.7">671</a>. Whether they keep slaves themselves does not appear.
</p>
<p>Several writers affirm that the Krus keep slaves. Miss Kingsley, however, who seems
to be well acquainted with them, speaks of “the Krus being a non-slave-holding tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n156.8src" href="#n156.8">672</a>. So we cannot arrive at a positive conclusion.
</p>
<p>“The Bobo” says Tautain “make no slaves; they hold slavery greatly in abhorrence.…
It seems that the Bobo are very industrious; as they have no slaves, they probably
have to work much harder than the Mandingoes and other neighbouring peoples”<a class="noteRef" id="n156.9src" href="#n156.9">673</a>.
</p>
<p>Corre informs us that “slavery exists among the Sereres. However, the inhabitants
of Fadiouth are said to have had captives during the last few years only, imitating
what they saw amongst the Wolof traders, most of whom are subjects of France. Independent
persons, such as a woman without a husband or family, may sell themselves to any one
who is willing to buy them”<a class="noteRef" id="n156.10src" href="#n156.10">674</a>. This case may well be called a doubtful one.

<p class="first">Chaillé Long tells us that among the Chillooks the sheikh of each tribe detains as
slaves those who do not possess at least one cow<a class="noteRef" id="n157.2src" href="#n157.2">676</a>. No more particulars being given about slavery, we may put this down as a very doubtful
case.
</p>
<p>The Diour tribes make raids on each other. A large number of slaves are carried off
every year by the Arabian slave-traders<a class="noteRef" id="n157.3src" href="#n157.3">677</a>. Whether domestic slavery exists or not, we are not told.
</p>
<p>Among the Dinka every man has on an average three head of cattle, but there are also
poor people, who are the slaves or servants of the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n157.4src" href="#n157.4">678</a>. These “slaves or servants” very probably are not slaves. We may not, however, infer
that slavery does not exist here; for the notes our informants<a class="noteRef" id="n157.5src" href="#n157.5">679</a> give on their social life are very short.
</p>
<p>The Bari are themselves victims of the slave trade<a class="noteRef" id="n157.6src" href="#n157.6">680</a>. Whether they keep slaves, we are not told.
</p>
<p>Very minute descriptions are given in Stuhlmann’s book of the Latuka<a class="noteRef" id="n157.7src" href="#n157.7">681</a>, Alur<a class="noteRef" id="n157.8src" href="#n157.8">682</a> and Lendu<a class="noteRef" id="n157.9src" href="#n157.9">683</a>. No mention being made of slavery, we may be sure that it does not exist among them.
</p>
<p>Junker speaks of a chief of the Abukaja or Amadi, who made raids and divided the booty,
consisting of captured women and girls, with the allied chiefs and his subjects. Such
is the <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>custom, says Junker, and therefore the men like to go to war. In another place he
speaks of captured women with children and infants, and girls<a class="noteRef" id="n158.1src" href="#n158.1">684</a>. Whether these captured persons are kept among the Abukaja or exported, and if the
former, whether they are made slaves, we do not know.
</p>
<p>The same author speaks of slaves among the Makaraka; but it is not clear, whether
they keep these slaves or sell them to the Arabians, who carry on the slave-trade
on a large scale in these regions<a class="noteRef" id="n158.2src" href="#n158.2">685</a>.
</p>
<p>The Niam-Niam in their wars capture many women. Schweinfurth supposes, that they retain
the captured women as slaves, but kill the men. Junker also speaks of female slaves.
According to him male slaves are sometimes sacrificed; but it is not clear, whether
the latter are ordinary slaves or only bought or captured to be sacrificed<a class="noteRef" id="n158.3src" href="#n158.3">686</a>. Our information does not admit of any accurate conclusion.
</p>
<p>Schweinfurth’s description seems to show, that the Mombuttus have male slaves. Junker
speaks only of female slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n158.4src" href="#n158.4">687</a>. Burrows says: “Between the chief and the people are a race of freed men, who do
not engage in manual labour of any kind. From the term freed men it must not be inferred
that the people below them are slaves; they are equally free, but are without the
hereditary rank of the so-called freed men, who are generally relations of the chief
or in some way connected with him<a class="noteRef" id="n158.5src" href="#n158.5">688</a>.” Hence it would appear that slavery does not exist among them. These conflicting
statements do not allow us to arrive at a safe conclusion.
</p>
<p>The Wagungo proper, says Junker, do hardly any work themselves; they leave it all
to their slaves, the Schuli and Tschappu<a class="noteRef" id="n158.6src" href="#n158.6">689</a>. These Schuli and Tschappu seem to be subjected tribes rather than slaves; but as
further particulars are wanting, we feel unable to decide.
</p>
<p>Among the Warundi slavery is unknown<a class="noteRef" id="n158.7src" href="#n158.7">690</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>The same applies to the Wafiomi<a class="noteRef" id="n159.1src" href="#n159.1">691</a>, Wataturu<a class="noteRef" id="n159.2src" href="#n159.2">692</a>, and Wambugwe<a class="noteRef" id="n159.3src" href="#n159.3">693</a>.
</p>
<p>The several describers of the Bongos, who give many details of their social life,
make no mention of slavery; hence we may infer that it does not exist among them<a class="noteRef" id="n159.4src" href="#n159.4">694</a>.

<p class="first">The Boobies of Fernando-Po, according to Compiègne, have numerous slaves. Hutchinson
states, that in their wars they spare neither age nor sex<a class="noteRef" id="n159.5src" href="#n159.5">695</a>. So the slaves are probably purchased foreigners.
</p>
<p>Sibree, describing the Sakalavas of Madagascar, speaks of a kind of temple, which
slaves may not enter, for should they do so they would become free<a class="noteRef" id="n159.6src" href="#n159.6">696</a>. According to Hildebrandt the occupations of the Sakalavas are not multifarious.
The men tend the cattle and now and then sell a beast, and sometimes help the women
in the little plantations. In the rice district of North Sakalavaland, where rice
is cultivated for export, more labour is wanted on the fields; therefore in this district
many slaves are kept<a class="noteRef" id="n159.7src" href="#n159.7">697</a>. It is not clear, whether our informant means to say, that in the other districts
of Sakalavaland there are no slaves; at any rate we may conclude, that among the Northern
Sakalavas slavery exists.
</p>
<p>Slavery also exists among the inhabitants of the small islands of Nossi-Bé and Mayotte,
many of whom belong to the Sakalavas<a class="noteRef" id="n159.8src" href="#n159.8">698</a>.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fritsch, at the beginning of his description of the Hottentots or Koi-Koin, states
that in his time these tribes had already been much changed from their aboriginal
state; so he had to rely on the statements of ancient writers, several of which bear
a rather fantastic character<a class="noteRef" id="n161.1src" href="#n161.1">699</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Namaqua, one of the Hottentot tribes, he says, that the state of women is not
so bad as among most South African tribes. The men assist their wives in the hard
work; moreover a class of servants or slaves exists here. “This lowest class of people—one
might object to our calling them “slaves”, as there is no established law distinguishing
slaves from freemen—among the Namaqua mainly consists of individuals belonging to
the despised tribes of Mountain-Damara and Bushmen. These people are looked upon as
inferior by their very birth, and (like the Vaalpenz among the Bechuanas) regard bad
treatment as inevitably connected with their origin, without being slaves by law.
Serfs (<i lang="de">Leibeigenen</i>) in the proper sense of the word may be called those only who, as prisoners of war,
or by surrendering at discretion (like the Fengu among the Caffres), become subjected
to men of power; of these there are but few among the Namaqua tribes, but among all
South African natives the rich tyrannize over the poor who, in the hope of filling
their stomachs, comply with a state of dependence which is not authorized by law.”
According to Th. Hahn, he who ill-treats or even barbarously murders a slave, is not
punished<a class="noteRef" id="n161.2src" href="#n161.2">700</a>. This statement is not very clear. Fritsch speaks here of three kinds of “servants
or slaves”: <i>a.</i> poor dependent on the rich; these certainly are servants and not slaves; <i>b.</i> individuals belonging to despised tribes; of these Fritsch <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>says, that they are not slaves by law, and as no more details are given, we cannot
make out what they are; <i>c.</i> prisoners of war and those who have surrendered at discretion. These, according to
Fritsch, are the only <i lang="de">Leibeigenen</i> in the proper sense; but he compares them to the Fengu, who, as we saw in § 15, are
subjected tribes rather than slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n162.1src" href="#n162.1">701</a>. Galton remarks: “Though no slaves are exported from the countries in which I travelled,
yet there is a kind of slavery in the countries themselves. It is not easy to draw
a line between slavery and servitude; but I should say that the relation of the master
to the man was, at least in Damara and Hottentotland, that of owner rather than employer.
The Namaqua Hottentots and Oorlams, in all their plundering excursions, capture and
drive back with them such Damara youths as they take a fancy to, and they keep them,
and assert every kind of right over them. They punish them just as they please, and
even shoot them, without any one attempting to interfere. Next in the scale of slavery
are those Damaras, Ghou Damup, or Bushmen, who place themselves under Hottentot “protection”,
and on much the same footing as those among the Hottentots, are the paupers that are
attached to different werfts among the Damaras<a class="noteRef" id="n162.2src" href="#n162.2">702</a>”. We see that Galton, like Fritsch, is uncertain as to whether the subjected classes
among the Namaqua are to be called slaves. According to Wandrer, whose description
applies to a later period than the foregoing accounts, there are no slaves, but a
kind of serfs, most of them Herero, who were formerly prisoners of war<a class="noteRef" id="n162.3src" href="#n162.3">703</a>. Considering all this, we cannot arrive at any definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>In his description of the other Hottentot tribes, viz. the Griqua, Korana, and Colonial
Hottentots, Fritsch makes no mention of slavery. Holub remarks: “Where a well-to-do
Korana can afford to keep some Makalahiri and Masarwa as servants and slaves, the
soil is tilled to a small extent<a class="noteRef" id="n162.4src" href="#n162.4">704</a>”. We have before met with these Makalahiri and Masarwa as tribes subjected to the
Bechuanas; this makes us doubt, whether the “slaves” Holub speaks of are not divisions
of the same tribes subjected to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>Korana, rather than slaves in the proper sense; the more so as he speaks of “servants
and slaves”.
</p>
<p>The describers of the Bushmen<a class="noteRef" id="n163.1src" href="#n163.1">705</a> make no mention of slavery. Fritsch tells us that they adopted parts of the declining
Hottentots into their hordes<a class="noteRef" id="n163.2src" href="#n163.2">706</a>, so we may safely infer that slavery did not exist among them.
</p>
<p>None of the describers of the Akkas<a class="noteRef" id="n163.3src" href="#n163.3">707</a> speak of slaves. Burrows tells us that they “purchase their implements, such as spears,
arrow-heads, and knives, from their neighbours, in exchange for dried meat, or for
captives they have taken in the bush.” But as the same writer states that “each village
is ruled by a chief or head man, but among the people there is no variation of rank<a class="noteRef" id="n163.4src" href="#n163.4">708</a>”, we may safely suppose that they sell abroad all captives they have made, and do
not keep any of them as slaves.
</p>
<p>Of the Abongos we know little, far too little to make out whether slavery exists among
them<a class="noteRef" id="n163.5src" href="#n163.5">709</a>.
</p>
<p>The Mucassequere, according to Serpa Pinto, sell the captives they make in their wars
as slaves to the Ambuella, who transmit them to Bihé caravans<a class="noteRef" id="n163.6src" href="#n163.6">710</a>. We may therefore suppose that they do not keep slaves.

<p class="first">Munzinger, in his excellent books, describes several of these <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>tribes, all of which keep slaves: Beduan<a class="noteRef" id="n164.1src" href="#n164.1">711</a>, Takue<a class="noteRef" id="n164.2src" href="#n164.2">712</a>, Marea<a class="noteRef" id="n164.3src" href="#n164.3">713</a>, Beni Amer<a class="noteRef" id="n164.4src" href="#n164.4">714</a>, Barea and Kunama<a class="noteRef" id="n164.5src" href="#n164.5">715</a>, Bogos<a class="noteRef" id="n164.6src" href="#n164.6">716</a>.

<p>The Gallas practise slavery to a great extent<a class="noteRef" id="n164.7src" href="#n164.7">717</a>.

<p>The Somal and Danakil also have slaves, though not so many as the Gallas<a class="noteRef" id="n164.8src" href="#n164.8">718</a>.

<p>Kannenberg, in his short notes on his journey through the country of the Warangi,
remarks that captives are made slaves. But in Baumstark’s elaborate description of
this tribe no mention is made of slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n164.10src" href="#n164.10">720</a>. We may therefore conclude, that the Warangi do not keep slaves. If Kannenberg’s
statement is correct, the prisoners certainly become victims of the slave trade, which
in his time was carried on to a great extent in German East Africa<a class="noteRef" id="n164.11src" href="#n164.11">721</a>.
</p>
<p>The Wandorobo have been described by several authors<a class="noteRef" id="n164.12src" href="#n164.12">722</a>, who do not make any mention of slaves. They are themselves subjected to the Massai<a class="noteRef" id="n164.13src" href="#n164.13">723</a>. We may safely conclude that they have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n164.14src" href="#n164.14">724</a>.
</p>
<p>The Wakwafi also probably have no slaves; for none of their describers<a class="noteRef" id="n164.15src" href="#n164.15">725</a> say a word about slavery.

<p>Several North-African peoples, such as the Fulbe, the Tuareg, the Kabyls, etc., being
semi-civilized rather than savages, have been excluded here<a class="noteRef" id="n165.1src" href="#n165.1">726</a>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the preceding paragraphs we have tried to find, which savage tribes have, and which
have not, slaves. But we suppose that our enumeration of positive and negative cases
has not yet given the reader a clear idea of the occurrence of slavery in the several
geographical districts; probably he does not see the wood for trees. So we shall take
here a short survey, serving, so to speak, as a map and showing in which parts of
the globe slave-keeping savage tribes are found.
</p>
<p>In North America slavery exists along the Pacific Coast from Behring Strait to the
Northern boundary of California (15 clear positive cases). Beyond this district it
seems to be unknown (42 clear negative cases).
</p>
<p>In Central and South America we find 9 positive and 17 negative cases<a class="noteRef" id="n165.2src" href="#n165.2">727</a>. The positive cases are scattered over the whole continent; there are no large positive
or negative districts. Such, at least, is the result we arrive at with the aid of
our rather incomplete literature; a better literature would perhaps show that such
districts exist.
</p>
<p>In Australia slavery is unknown (30 negative cases).
</p>
<p>In Oceania, <i>i.e.</i> Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia, slaves are only found in New Zealand, the North-Western
Solomon Islands, the Gazelle Peninsula of Neu Pommern and the Western part of New
Guinea (altogether 8 pos. cases). In the rest of this group (except a few uncertain
cases) slavery does not exist (30 neg. cases).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Malay Archipelago slavery very frequently occurs (69 pos. cases). The 8 negative
cases are scattered over the group.
</p>
<p>India and the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, taken together, afford 13 positive and 11 negative
cases, the former being found in the Northern parts of both groups.
</p>
<p>In Central Asia and Siberia slavery seems to be unknown, except among the Kamchadales
(in Central Asia 4 neg. cases, in Siberia 1 pos. case and 7 neg. cases).
</p>
<p>The Caucasus yields 3 positive cases, 1 negative case, and several doubtful cases.
Our literature on this group is rather scanty.
</p>
<p>The Arabian Aeneze Bedouins, as well as the Arabian Larbas who live in North Africa,
keep slaves (2 positive and no negative cases).
</p>
<p>As for Africa, the Northern part of this continent, being inhabited by semi-civilized
peoples, is excluded from our survey. Among the savage Africans slavery very frequently
occurs. There are only two districts, in which scarcely any clear positive cases are
found, viz. South Africa to the South of the Zambesi, and the country about the Upper
Nile, to the South-West of Abyssinia. Large agglomerations of slave-keeping tribes
are found on the Coast of Guinea, and in the district formed by Lower Guinea and the
territories bordering the Congo. A few negative cases, however, are interspersed among
the members of both groups, especially of the latter. There are altogether 90 pos.
and 31 neg. cases in Africa.
</p>
<p>All over the globe, there are, among the savage tribes on which we are sufficiently
informed, 210 with slaves and 181 without slaves.

to whether slavery in the proper sense exists in every case in which, relying on the
often superficial accounts of travellers, we conclude that slavery is present.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The foregoing passage and the whole of the present chapter are, we think, sufficient
evidence that we have set ourselves the task of subjecting the accounts of travellers
and other writers on savage tribes, on which our conclusions are to be based, to a
critical examination. There may be particular instances in which we have failed in
this respect; but we believe our conclusions on the whole rest upon a solid basis
and Dr. Tönnies’s objection, in corroboration of which he does not adduce a single
fact, does not seem to us well founded.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n42.1src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

first because the Padam Abors are organized in republican and even communistic clans,
in which slavery is hardly possible (why?); secondly because the young slaves live
together with the young freemen in communal long-houses. This last remark proves that
Letourneau is not very familiar with the character of primitive slavery.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n126.8src" title="Return to note 464 in text.">↑</a></p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The results of the first Part will be utilized in this. We have seen that slavery
exists or formerly existed among many savage tribes, whereas many others have always,
as far as we know, been unacquainted with it. The present Part will be taken up with
an inquiry into the causes of these phenomena. We shall try to find out, what kinds
of tribes have slaves, and what kinds have not.
</p>
<p>To this end it would seem best to divide the several tribes according to their general
culture, and then to inquire at which stages of culture slavery is found. But such
a division cannot be made here incidentally; for it would require years of labour.
And a good division, that we could adopt, has not yet been made. Morgan distinguishes
three periods of savagery, three of barbarism, and one of civilization<a class="noteRef" id="n169.1src" href="#n169.1">1</a>. But his system rests on the unproved supposition, that the stage of culture a people
has attained to entirely depends on its technical ability in the arts of subsistence.
Dr. Vierkandt has made another distinction. Besides the civilized and semi-civilized
peoples he has two categories: migratory tribes (<i lang="de">unstete Völker</i>), and primitive peoples proper (<i lang="de">eigentliche Naturvölker</i>). The former are the Australians, Tasmanians, Andamanese, Veddahs, Negritos, Kubus,
Bushmen, African pigmy-tribes, Fuegians and Botocudos; the latter the American Indians,
Arctic races, <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>Northern Asiatics, Caucasus tribes, hill-tribes of India, Negroes to the South of
the Soudan, inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago and Oceanic Islands<a class="noteRef" id="n170.1src" href="#n170.1">2</a>. But this division cannot be of any use to us. It is not the result of an extensive
and accurate examination of the facts; the writer himself admits that he has followed
his general impressions<a class="noteRef" id="n170.2src" href="#n170.2">3</a>. Now the impressions of a capable sociologist, as Vierkandt undoubtedly is, may count
for something; they give a hint as to the direction, in which the investigation has
to be carried on; but they do not themselves afford a scientific basis to rely upon.
His <i lang="de">unstete Völker</i> are simply those generally known as the “lowest type of man”, whether justly or unjustly
we do not know<a class="noteRef" id="n170.3src" href="#n170.3">4</a>. And his <i lang="de">eigentliche Naturvölker</i>, as Professor Steinmetz rightly remarks<a class="noteRef" id="n170.4src" href="#n170.4">5</a>, comprehend savages of widely different degrees of development. Moreover, although
he says his criterion is the psychical state of man, the economic side of social life
comes always prominently into view<a class="noteRef" id="n170.5src" href="#n170.5">6</a>; but the author does not even try to prove that the psychical state of man depends
upon the stage of economic development.
</p>
<p>Yet, as it can be easily done here, we may inquire whether Vierkandt’s <i lang="de">unstete Völker</i> have slaves. It will be seen from the second Chapter of our first Part that all of
them, with the exception perhaps of the Negritos, are unacquainted with slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n170.6src" href="#n170.6">7</a>. This conclusion, however, is not of much use to us, as we do not know whether they
have been justly or unjustly classified under one <span class="corr" id="xd32e10010" title="Source: catagory">category</span>.
</p>
<p>As little can the other attempts, which have been made, to classify the savages according
to their general culture, serve our purpose<a class="noteRef" id="n170.7src" href="#n170.7">8</a>. So the method of investigation that would seem the best is not applicable here.
Therefore we are also unable <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>to ascertain whether, as some writers assert, slavery at a certain stage of social
development is universal. Bagehot says of slavery: “There is a wonderful presumption
in its favour; it is one of the institutions which, at a certain stage of growth,
all nations in all countries choose and cleave to”<a class="noteRef" id="n171.1src" href="#n171.1">9</a>. Grünberg expresses the same view: “No people has always and in all phases of its
development been unacquainted with slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n171.2src" href="#n171.2">10</a>. According to Spencer “observation of all societies in all times shows that slavery
is the rule and freedom the exception”<a class="noteRef" id="n171.3src" href="#n171.3">11</a>. And Tourmagne exclaims: “This almost universal scourge, going back to the very origin
of the nations and affecting all of them, is it not to be regarded as a social stage
that every people has to traverse, as an evolution which it is obliged to undergo,
before it can attain to the higher degrees of civilization”<a class="noteRef" id="n171.4src" href="#n171.4">12</a>? If we had an ascending series of stages of culture, we might inquire whether, within
the limits of savagery (for the civilized and semi-civilized peoples fall beyond the
scope of the present volume) there is a stage at which slavery is universal. But,
as we have already remarked, this is not yet possible.
</p>
<p>The best method we can use now will be to take into view one prominent side of social
life, that may reasonably be supposed to have much influence on the social structure,
especially on the division of labour; and to inquire whether this one factor may entirely,
and if not to what extent it may, account for the existence or non-existence of slavery
in every particular case. Here the economic side of life comes in the first place
into consideration. We are not among the adherents of the materialistic theory of
history; it is quite unproved and seems to us very one-sided. But we may suppose that
the division of labour between the several social groups within a tribe, and therefore
also the existence or non-existence of slavery, largely depends on the manner in which
the tribe gets its subsistence. Whether, and to what extent, this supposition is true,
will be shown by the examination of the facts. If this hypothesis fails to account
for all the facts, we shall try, with the aid of other hypotheses, to explain the
rest.
</p>
<p>The opinion that the existence of slavery mainly depends <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>on the mode of subsistence is also held by many theorists. According to Morgan “slavery,
which in the Upper Status of barbarism became the fate of the captive, was unknown
among tribes in the Lower Status in the aboriginal period”. This Lower Status of barbarism
begins with “the invention or practice of the art of pottery”. Anterior to the art
of pottery was “the commencement of village life, with some degree of control over
subsistence”. It ends with “the domestication of animals in the Eastern hemisphere,
and in the Western with cultivation by irrigation and with the use of adobe-brick
and stone in architecture”<a class="noteRef" id="n172.1src" href="#n172.1">13</a>. So slavery, according to Morgan, does not exist before a rather advanced period.
</p>
<p>Several writers assert that hunters and fishers never have slaves. Schmoller was formerly
of the opinion that “no people unacquainted with cattle-breeding and agriculture has
slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n172.2src" href="#n172.2">14</a>. In his handbook, however, he informs us, that some highly developed tribes of fishers
also keep slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n172.3src" href="#n172.3">15</a>. Ingram expresses the view formerly held by Schmoller: “In the hunter period the
savage warrior does not enslave his vanquished enemy, but slays him; the women of
the conquered tribe he may, however, carry off and appropriate as wives or as servants,
for in this period domestic labour falls almost altogether on the female sex. In the
pastoral stage slaves are captured only to be sold, with the exception of a few who
may be required for the care of flocks or the small amount of cultivation which is
then undertaken. It is in proportion as a sedentary life prevails, and agricultural
exploitation is practised on a larger scale, whilst warlike habits continue to exist,
that the labour of slaves is increasingly introduced to provide food for the master,
and at the same time save him from irksome toil. Of this stage in the social movement
slavery seems to have been a universal and inevitable accompaniment.” But he makes
an exception in the case of those communities where “theocratic organisations established
themselves”<a class="noteRef" id="n172.4src" href="#n172.4">16</a>. Flügel says: “Hunting tribes can neither feed nor employ the prisoners; generally
they kill them”<a class="noteRef" id="n172.5src" href="#n172.5">17</a>. According to Schurtz “among tribes of migratory hunters there <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>is no room for slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n173.1src" href="#n173.1">18</a>. Whether he means here all hunters or only Vierkandt’s <i lang="de">unstete Völker</i> is not clear.
</p>
<p>Pastoral nomadism especially is considered favourable to the growth of slavery. The
nomadic herdsman, who had learned to domesticate animals, began also to domesticate
men, <i>i.e.</i> to enslave them. According to Lippert, slavery “first arises in the patriarchal communities
of pastoral peoples.” “They [the slaves] were the object of an appropriation entirely
similar to the appropriation of the domestic animals”<a class="noteRef" id="n173.2src" href="#n173.2">19</a>. Lamprecht also asserts that the prisoners, who formerly were either sacrificed or
adopted into the community, in the pastoral stage were enslaved, because many hands
were wanted to tend the cattle<a class="noteRef" id="n173.3src" href="#n173.3">20</a>. Dimitroff says that originally the captives were instantly killed like the game,
as was the case amongst the hunting tribes of America, Australia and Africa. But as
soon as man began to tame animals, he also learned to employ the captives as labourers<a class="noteRef" id="n173.4src" href="#n173.4">21</a>.
</p>
<p>A few theorists, however, who are more familiar with ethnographical literature, know
that it is not only among pastoral and agricultural tribes that slavery is found.
So Peschel states. According to him hunters cannot employ slaves. Fishers, however,
sometimes do so, as on the Northwest Coast of America, amongst the Koniagas, Koloshes,
and Ahts of Vancouver Island. But only at the agricultural stage is slavery practised
on an extensive scale<a class="noteRef" id="n173.5src" href="#n173.5">22</a>. Wagner is of the same opinion: “In the earliest economic state of society slavery
is quite or nearly unknown; generally speaking slavery is coeval with a settled and
agricultural life. This is to be accounted for by economic causes; for only in the
agricultural stage can slave labour be of any considerable use. Therefore slavery
is unknown among hunters, and occurs but seldom among fishers. Bondage (<i lang="de">Unfreiheit</i>) presents itself already under several forms among nomadic herdsmen; but only among
settled agricultural peoples does it attain to its full development”<a class="noteRef" id="n173.6src" href="#n173.6">23</a>. Tylor remarks that slavery exists, as soon as the captives are spared to till the
soil; but he adds that even among savage hunters and foresters absolute equality is
not <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>always to be found<a class="noteRef" id="n174.1src" href="#n174.1">24</a>. Spencer says: “Tribes which have not emerged from the hunting stage are little given
to enslaving the vanquished; if they do not kill and eat them they adopt them. In
the absence of industrial activity, slaves are almost useless, and indeed, where game
is scarce, are not worth their food. But where, as among fishing tribes like the Chinooks,
captives can be of use, or where the pastoral and agricultural stages have been reached,
there arises a motive for sparing the lives of conquered men, and after inflicting
on them such mutilations as mark their subjection, setting them to work”<a class="noteRef" id="n174.2src" href="#n174.2">25</a>. Bos is also aware of the fact, that the Tlinkits and similar tribes have slaves.
He explains this in a curious way: slavery does not agree with the nature of hunting
tribes; therefore it is probable that these tribes formerly were agricultural to a
small extent<a class="noteRef" id="n174.3src" href="#n174.3">26</a>. Felix remarks that slavery already exists at the beginning of the agricultural stage<a class="noteRef" id="n174.4src" href="#n174.4">27</a>. Mommsen, however, asserts that in the oldest times (until when does not appear)
slavery did not prevail to any considerable extent; more use was made of free labourers<a class="noteRef" id="n174.5src" href="#n174.5">28</a>.
</p>
<p>Letourneau expresses his opinion very prudently: slavery was not carried on on a large
scale before men applied themselves to cattle-breeding and especially to agriculture<a class="noteRef" id="n174.6src" href="#n174.6">29</a>. At the end of his book on slavery of over 500 pages he contents himself with this
vague conclusion.
</p>
<p>We see that the theories disagree very much. Whether any of them agree with the facts
will appear from the investigation we are about to undertake.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 2.</span> <i>Distinction of economic groups.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This investigation will be carried on in the following manner. The tribes that afforded
clear cases in the second chapter of the first Part will be divided into several groups
according to their economic state. It will be seen then how many positive and how
many negative cases there are in each group; and we <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>shall try to explain why the result is such as we shall find it. Perhaps we shall
be able to account for this result entirely by economic causes; if not, we shall inquire
what other causes there may be.
</p>
<p>The following economic states will be distinguished:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1º. Hunting and fishing,
</li>
<li>2º. Pastoral nomadism,
</li>
<li>3º. First stage of agriculture,
</li>
<li>4º. Second stage of agriculture,
</li>
<li>5º. Third stage of agriculture.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>It has to be remarked that this is not an ascending series of stages of economic development.
What the economic evolution has been we do not exactly know. Little credit is given
to-day to the old division into the three successive stages of hunting, pastoral nomadism,
and agriculture. This was not yet so in 1884, when Dargun could still write: “The
evolutionary stages of hunting, pastoral, and agricultural life are so well established
in science as stages of human evolution in general, that it seems rather audacious
to object to this division. Taken in general, however, it is false; on the greater
half of the globe pastoral life was not a transitory stage from hunting to agriculture;
therefore the people concerned had not to pass through any regulation of property
peculiar to herdsmen. They learned agriculture without having been pastoral. This
phenomenon comprehends two parts of the world—America and Australia-Polynesia—completely,
and two other parts—Asia and Africa—to a great extent, as the Malay Archipelago and
the territory of the Negro tribes across Africa also are included. Therefore it will
be necessary to leave off considering the three stages of hunting, pastoral and agricultural
life as a rule of human progress. Moreover, nearly all pastoral tribes carry on agriculture,
however negligently; and it is not at all certain that the origin of the latter does
not go back to a more remote period than cattle-breeding; it is even probable that
<span class="corr" id="xd32e10149" title="Source: is">it</span> does, for nomadic herdsmen are on the whole more civilized than the rudest agricultural
tribes: cattle-breeding therefore is posterior to primitive agriculture”<a class="noteRef" id="n175.1src" href="#n175.1">30</a>. This <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>view of Dargun’s is now generally accepted. But a new ascending series that would
have any scientific value does not yet exist. And so we can only distinguish economic
states, not stages of economic development.
</p>
<p>A few remarks must still be made on each of our groups. These remarks will also serve
to justify our division.
</p>
<p>I. Hunting and fishing.
</p>
<p>This group comprehends those tribes only that are entirely unacquainted with agriculture
and cattle-breeding. Sometimes agriculture is carried on to such a small extent, that
the tribe subsists almost entirely on hunting, fishing and gathering wild vegetable
food. Such tribes bear much resemblance to true hunters; but if we called them hunting
tribes it would be very difficult to draw the line of demarcation between them and
other agricultural tribes; moreover, such tribes are not exactly in the same economic
state as true hunters. So we have classified them under the agricultural groups.
</p>
<p>Such tribes as use animals (especially horses) only as a means of locomotion, are
hunters, viz. if they are unacquainted with agriculture; at any rate they are not
pastoral tribes. This is the case with several tribes of North and South America.
</p>
<p>II. Pastoral nomadism.
</p>
<p>The tribes belonging to this group subsist mainly on the milk and meat of their cattle.
Most of them also undertake a small amount of cultivation (see the above-quoted passage
of Dargun’s), whereas many agricultural tribes rear cattle. We shall draw the line
of demarcation thus: this second group will contain those tribes only that depend
so much on their cattle, that the whole tribe or the greater part of it is nomadic;
whereas those who, although living for a considerable part on the produce of their
cattle, have fixed habitations, will be classified under the agricultural groups.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>III, IV, V. Agriculture.
</p>
<p>Grosse makes a distinction between lower and higher agriculture; but as the former
comprehends nearly all agricultural savages, this distinction cannot be of any use
to us<a class="noteRef" id="n177.1src" href="#n177.1">31</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Hahn, in his book on the domestic animals, distinguishes hoe-culture (<i lang="de">Hackbau</i>), agriculture proper (<i lang="de">Ackerbau</i>) and horticulture (<i lang="de">Gartenbau</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n177.2src" href="#n177.2">32</a>. But hoe-culture is carried on by nearly all agricultural savages; besides, this
division is purely technical and therefore cannot serve our purpose. What we want
is a division according to the place agriculture occupies in social life. We must
ask to what extent a tribe is occupied in and dependent for subsistence on agriculture.
For on this, and not on the form of the agricultural implements, it will depend whether
slaves are wanted to till the soil. A slave may be set to handle the hoe as well as
the plough.
</p>
<p>Perusing the ethnographical literature, we found such great differences between the
several savage tribes in this respect, that we have thought it best to distinguish
three stages of agriculture<a class="noteRef" id="n177.3src" href="#n177.3">33</a>. The principle according to which the distinction will be made is, as we have already
hinted, the extent to which a tribe depends upon agriculture for its subsistence.
The <i>first</i> agricultural group will contain those cases, in which agriculture holds a subordinate
place, most of the subsistence being derived from other sources, viz. hunting, fishing
or gathering wild-growing vegetable food<a class="noteRef" id="n177.4src" href="#n177.4">34</a>. The tribes of the <i>second</i> group carry on agriculture to a considerable extent, but not to the exclusion of
hunting, etc. The <i>third</i>, or highest, agricultural stage is reached, when agriculture is by far the principal
mode of subsistence, and hunting, etc. hold a very <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>subordinate place, so much so that, if the latter were entirely wanting, the economic
state would be nearly the same.
</p>
<p>But our information is not always very complete; and so it is not always clear to
what extent subsistence is derived from agriculture. In such cases we shall make use
of some <i>secondary characteristics</i>. Some facts may be recorded from which we can more or less safely draw conclusions
as to the place agriculture occupies. The facts indicative of the first stage of agriculture
are: 1. Women only are occupied in agriculture<a class="noteRef" id="n178.1src" href="#n178.1">35</a>, 2. The tribe is very mobile, habitations are often shifted. Those indicative of
the second, as distinguished from the first, stage are: 1. The tribe has fixed habitations
(except where this is due to an abundance of fish or fruit-bearing trees), 2. The
lands are irrigated. Those indicative of the third stage are: 1. The lands are manured,
2. Rotation of crops is carried on, 3. Domestic animals are used in agriculture, 4.
Agricultural products are exported.
</p>
<p>It is not, of course, necessary that in every case a whole set of characteristics
is found. Sometimes a part of them only are mentioned. Besides, there is much overlapping:
a characteristic of the first stage may be found connected with one of the third.
In all such cases we must not forget that these secondary characteristics have only
signification as indications of the place occupied by agriculture, so they have not
a fixed value; in every particular case the manner in which they are mentioned, the
place they hold in the whole of the description, etc. will decide what importance
we are to attach to each of them.
</p>
<p>Hitherto we have supposed that agricultural tribes did nothing else besides tilling
the soil, except hunting, fishing and gathering wild vegetable food. But it may also
be that they subsist partly on agriculture, partly on cattle-breeding or trade<a class="noteRef" id="n178.2src" href="#n178.2">36</a>. In these cases we cannot apply the same principle of division. A tribe that subsists
partly on agriculture, but chiefly on trade is not to be classified under the same
category as a tribe that subsists partly on agriculture, but mainly on hunting. The
latter <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>is not yet agricultural, the former has perhaps passed beyond the agricultural stage.
Here we may regard only the technical ability attained to in agriculture. Where agriculture
is technically little developed, we have probably to deal with former <i lang="de">Jägerbauern</i> who have become traders. Where agriculture has reached a high perfection, but trade
is one of the chief modes of subsistence, the tribe has probably passed through the
higher stages of agriculture. What we say here of trade equally applies to cattle-breeding.
</p>
<p>There are a few tribes that afforded clear cases in the second chapter of our first
Part, but about the economic state of which we are not sufficiently informed. These
will be left out here.
</p>
<p>The literature used is the same as in Part I chap. II<a class="noteRef" id="n179.1src" href="#n179.1">37</a>. We have not thought it necessary to quote the pages relating to each tribe. In most
ethnographical records the mode of subsistence occupies a conspicuous place, so any
one wishing to verify our conclusions may easily find the passages concerned.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We shall give here a list of the tribes that afforded “clear cases” in the second
chapter of Part I, stating, after the name of each tribe, the economic condition in
which it lives. As we have said before, we shall omit a few tribes, about the economic
state of which we are not sufficiently informed.
</p>
<p>It will not perhaps be superfluous to remind the reader that, as our list contains
only “clear cases”, it gives no evidence as to the economic state of each geographical
group. If, for instance, in our list some geographical group contains as many hunting
as agricultural tribes, this does not prove that in this group hunters and agriculturists
are equally divided; for the group may contain many more tribes, which in our second
chapter have not afforded “clear cases”; and what is the economic state of these tribes
does not appear from our list.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the agricultural tribes we have separately noted those, among which subsistence
depends largely either on cattle-breeding or on trade, in addition to agriculture.
</p>
<p>We shall make use of the following abbreviations.

that the result of our investigations amounts to very little, the reason being that
we have confined ourselves to the study of those peoples among which the cultivation
of the soil is of no consequence. The mere fact, that our chapter on agricultural
tribes occupies more spaces than the chapters on hunters and fishers and on pastoral
tribes taken together, proves the incorrectness of Dr. Hahn’s remark.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n177.2src" title="Return to note 32 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p>So the great majority of the 88 cases we have got are negative. This fact agrees with
the opinion of those theorists who assert that this economic state is unfavourable
to the development of slavery. The existence of 18 positive cases, however, shows
that those are wrong who hold that no tribe unacquainted with agriculture and cattle-breeding
ever has slaves.
</p>
<p>We have to explain now, why most hunters and fishers do not keep slaves. In a few
cases the fact that they are inclosed between superior peoples and reduced to a dependent,
powerless state, might afford sufficient explanation. So the Wandorobo, according
to Thomson, are considered by the Massai as a kind of serfs; and Johnston calls them
a helot race<a class="noteRef" id="n192.1src" href="#n192.1">1</a>. But with most of our hunters and fishers, who do not keep slaves, this is not the
case, as is proved by their being often at war with their neighbours. It has been
shown that the Ojibways and Sioux in North America, the Charruas, Minuanes and Puelches
in South America either killed or adopted their prisoners, that the Andamanese also
sometimes adopt captive children, that the Montagnais generally tortured their prisoners
to death, that warfare is also known among the Botocudos<a class="noteRef" id="n192.2src" href="#n192.2">2</a>. And the most striking evidence is afforded by the Australians, an isolated group
consisting entirely of hunters, in which slavery is altogether unknown. So the non-existence
of slavery among the great majority of the hunters and fishers must be due on the
whole to more general causes; and only if the latter fail to account for the absence
of slavery among the <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>Wandorobo or any other tribe in a similar subjected state, may we have recourse to
an explanation by this state.
</p>
<p>What general causes may there be? Spencer, speaking of hunters, says: “In the absence
of industrial activity, slaves are almost useless; and, indeed, where game is scarce,
are not worth their food”<a class="noteRef" id="n193.1src" href="#n193.1">3</a>. It is true, where food is more plentiful than it is among most hunters, slaves can
be of more use; but we cannot think that the only cause why slavery does not exist,
is that the slave is “not worth his food”, <i>i.e.</i> that the produce of a man’s labour cannot much exceed his own primary wants. For
we meet with several instances, among these tribes, of people whose wants are provided
for by the labour of others. In our first Part we saw, that the Australian men depend
largely for their subsistence on the work of their wives. Some other statements are
indicative of a similar state of things. Dawson says of the natives of the Western
District of Victoria: “Great respect is paid to the chiefs and their wives and families.
They can command the services of every one belonging to their tribe. As many as six
young bachelors are obliged to wait on a chief, and eight young unmarried women on
his wife; and as the children are of superior rank to the common people, they also
have a number of attendants to wait on them.… Food and water, when brought to the
camp, must be offered to them first, and reeds provided for each in the family to
drink with, while the common people drink in the usual way. Should they fancy any
article of dress, opossum rug, or weapon, it must be given without a murmur”<a class="noteRef" id="n193.2src" href="#n193.2">4</a>. And of the chiefs of the Andaman Islanders we are told: “They and their wives are
at liberty to enjoy immunity from the drudgery incidental to their mode of life, all
such acts being voluntarily performed for them by the young unmarried persons living
under their headship”<a class="noteRef" id="n193.3src" href="#n193.3">5</a>.
</p>
<p>So there are people here whose wants are provided for by the work of others; therefore
scarcity of food cannot be the only cause why slavery does not exist, and we have
to examine what other causes there may be<a class="noteRef" id="n193.4src" href="#n193.4">6</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>The reader will remember, from the details given in the first Part, that slaves are
frequently acquired from without the community to which the slave’s owner belongs,
by war, kidnapping or trade. It may be convenient to give this phenomenon the technical
name of <i>extratribal slavery</i>, whereas we shall speak of <i>intratribal slavery</i> in those cases where the slave remains within the same community to which he belonged
before being enslaved, <i>e.g.</i> a debtor-slave. Now the keeping of extratribal slaves must be very difficult to hunters.
Hunting supposes a nomadic life; and the hunter, who roams over vast tracts of land
in pursuit of his game has not much opportunity to watch the movements of his slave,
who may be apt to run away at any moment. And if the slave himself is set to hunt,
the difficulty amounts nearly to impossibility. Moreover, the hunting slave will be
much more inclined to run away than a soil-tilling slave; for the latter, during his
flight, has to live in a make-shift way on the spontaneous products of nature; whereas
the former continues hunting, as he has always done; his flight has not the character
of a flight.
</p>
<p>Another cause is the following. Primitive hunters generally live in small groups.
Hildebrand remarks that at the lowest stage of culture men live together in families
or small tribes. Several instances are given in his book. “The Nilgala Veddahs are
distributed through their lovely country in small septs or families.” The Indians
of the Rocky Mountains “exist in small detached bodies or families.” The Fuegians
“appear to live in families, not in tribes.” The same applies to the Indians of Upper
California, the Woguls of Siberia, the Kubus, the Negritos, the Bushmen, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="n194.1src" href="#n194.1">7</a>. And Sutherland remarks: “The middle savages, on the average of six races, reach
about 150 as the social unit.” “The upper savages, as typified by the North American
Indians, would average about 360 to an encampment”<a class="noteRef" id="n194.2src" href="#n194.2">8</a>. Now it is easy to understand, that such small communities would not be able to develop
much coercive power over slaves introduced into the tribe from foreign parts. A fugitive
slave would be very soon beyond the reach of the tribe; and a comparatively small
number of slaves would be dangerous to <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>the maintenance of power by the tribesmen within the tribe.
</p>
<p>But the nomadic life of hunting tribes does not prevent the existence of intratribal
slavery; such slavery might even be compatible with living in small groups. There
are however other, more internal causes.
</p>
<p>If there were slaves, <i>i.e.</i> male slaves, for slavery proper does not exist where all slaves are women, they would
have to perform either the same work as free men, or the same work as free women.
One might object, that sometimes slaves have separate kinds of labour assigned to
them, which are performed by slaves only. This is true; but when slaves were first
kept it must have been otherwise. It is not to be supposed that men, convinced of
the utility of some new kind of work, began to procure slaves in order to make them
perform this work; or that, finding some work tedious, they invented slavery to relieve
themselves of this burden. Modern psychology does not account for psychical and social
phenomena in such a rationalistic way<a class="noteRef" id="n195.1src" href="#n195.1">9</a>. Differentiation of slave labour from free labour cannot have existed in the first
stage of slavery. Therefore two problems are to be solved: 1º. why are there no slaves
performing men’s work? 2º. why are there no slaves performing women’s work?
</p>
<p>Men’s work, besides warfare, is hunting. Now hunting is never a drudgery, but always
a noble and agreeable work. Occupying the whole soul and leaving no room for distracting
thought; offering the hunter a definite aim, to which he can reach by one mighty effort
of strength and skill; uncertain in its results like a battle, and promising the glory
of victory over a living creature; elevating the whole person, in a word intoxicating;
it agrees very well with the impulsiveness of savage character<a class="noteRef" id="n195.2src" href="#n195.2">10</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Therefore it is not a work fit to be imposed upon men who are deprived of the common
rights of freemen and are the property of others.
</p>
<p>For, first, good hunters are highly respected. This appears from several statements.
Ottawa women respected a man if he was a good hunter<a class="noteRef" id="n195.3src" href="#n195.3">11</a>. Tasmanian fathers took care to give their <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>daughters to the best hunters<a class="noteRef" id="n196.1src" href="#n196.1">12</a>. Among the Dumagas (a Negrito tribe) a man who wishes to marry must show his skill
in shooting<a class="noteRef" id="n196.2src" href="#n196.2">13</a>. Ojibway parents tried to give their daughters to good hunters. If the husband was
lazy the wife had a right to leave him<a class="noteRef" id="n196.3src" href="#n196.3">14</a>. In Western Victoria “if a chief is a man of ability, exhibiting bravery in battle
or skill in hunting, he is often presented with wives from other chiefs”<a class="noteRef" id="n196.4src" href="#n196.4">15</a>. Among the Andaman Islanders social status is dependent “on skill in hunting, fishing
etc. and on a reputation for generosity and hospitality”<a class="noteRef" id="n196.5src" href="#n196.5">16</a>. Le Jeune tells us of a Montagnais, who was laughed at because he was a bad hunter.
This was a great disgrace among the savages; for such men could never find or keep
a wife<a class="noteRef" id="n196.6src" href="#n196.6">17</a>. A describer of Kamchatka says of the dangerous sea-lion hunting: “This chase is
so honourable, that he who has killed most sea-lions is considered a hero; therefore
many men engage in it, less for the sake of the meat, that is looked upon as a delicacy,
than in order to win renown”<a class="noteRef" id="n196.7src" href="#n196.7">18</a>. In W. Washington and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon “a hunter is, in fact, looked upon with respect
by almost every tribe in the district”<a class="noteRef" id="n196.8src" href="#n196.8">19</a>. An ancient describer of the Indians of Paraguay tells us that skill and bravery
were the only qualities they valued. A would-be son-in-law had to bring game to the
hut of the girl’s parents. “From the kind and the quantity of the game the parents
judge whether he is a brave man and deserves to marry their daughter”<a class="noteRef" id="n196.9src" href="#n196.9">20</a>. Among the Northern Athabascans “none but a successful hunter need aspire to the
hand of a chief’s daughter”<a class="noteRef" id="n196.10src" href="#n196.10">21</a>. Among the Attakapas, if a young man aspired to the hand of a girl, her father asked
him whether he was a brave warrior and a good hunter and well acquainted with the
art of making harpoons<a class="noteRef" id="n196.11src" href="#n196.11">22</a>. Even among the pastoral Colonial Hottentots those who had killed a savage animal
were highly respected by their countrymen<a class="noteRef" id="n196.12src" href="#n196.12">23</a>. Personal qualities, among such tribes, are the only cause of social differentiation.
Wealth does not yet exist<a class="noteRef" id="n196.13src" href="#n196.13">24</a>; and hereditary nobility is unknown. So a good hunter cannot <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>be regarded by public opinion as a slave, the more so as a good hunter is also a good
warrior, and without the aid of public opinion the master is not able to keep him
subjected. And a bad hunter would be of little use as a hunting slave<a class="noteRef" id="n197.1src" href="#n197.1">25</a>.
</p>
<p>This prevents the growth of intratribal slavery: no member of the tribe is so superior
to any other member, that he can reduce him to a state of complete subjection; except
perhaps where the latter is physically or psychically much weaker; and then he would
not be of any use as a hunting slave. But it also prevents extratribal slavery. Enemies
are hated, but not despised. In Central North America prisoners are either killed
or adopted, and in the latter case entirely considered and treated as members of the
tribe. Sometimes a captive is spared for his bravery; he is then provided with all
necessaries and dismissed to his home<a class="noteRef" id="n197.2src" href="#n197.2">26</a>. Even those who are intended to be killed, are in the meantime treated with all due
honours, sometimes even provided with wives<a class="noteRef" id="n197.3src" href="#n197.3">27</a>. Enemies, at least full-grown men, if allowed to live, are on a footing of equality
with the tribesmen; another state of things is not yet thought possible<a class="noteRef" id="n197.4src" href="#n197.4">28</a>.
</p>
<p>But even if the idea of subjecting tribesmen or enemies had entered the minds of these
hunters, hunting slaves would not be of any use. For hunting requires the utmost application
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>strength and skill; therefore a compulsory hunting system cannot exist. If a man is
to exert all his faculties to the utmost, there must be other motives than mere compulsion.
It is for the same reason that in countries where manufactures are highly developed,
a system of labour other than slavery is required. “It remains certain” Stuart Mill
remarks “that slavery is incompatible with any high state of the arts of life, and
any great efficiency of labour. For all products which require much skill, slave countries
are usually dependent on foreigners.… All processes carried on by slave labour are
conducted in the rudest and most unimproved manner”<a class="noteRef" id="n198.1src" href="#n198.1">29</a>. And Cairnes says that the slave is “unsuited for all branches of industry which
require the slightest care, forethought, or dexterity. He cannot be made to co-operate
with machinery; he can only be trusted with the coarsest implements; he is incapable
of all but the rudest forms of labour”<a class="noteRef" id="n198.2src" href="#n198.2">30</a>. Mr. Kruijt, describing the natives of Central Celebes, speaks in the same way: “The
free Alifur works as hard as his slave and even harder; for during the hours that
there is nothing to do in the gardens, the freeman has to mend the furniture, plait
baskets, and cut handles from wood or horn etc., all which work the slave does not
understand”<a class="noteRef" id="n198.3src" href="#n198.3">31</a>. And Schurtz, in his most valuable essay on African industry, remarks: “Slavery has
little to do with the development of industry. Among the Negroes of Africa only free
people spend most of their time in industrial pursuits, the slaves performing at most
subordinate functions. In the Soudan there are slaves who work on their own account
and pay only a tribute to their master; but it scarcely ever happens that slaves are
made to work in large numbers for the purpose of manufacturing goods. Those artisans
who belong to pariah tribes are despised, but are not slaves, and the unwritten law
defends them from arbitrary treatment”<a class="noteRef" id="n198.4src" href="#n198.4">32</a>. A freeman may give his whole mind to his work, because he knows he will enjoy the
fruits of it, and still more because he will win a reputation by it among his fellow-men.
The slave has not these motives; <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>he works mainly on compulsion<a class="noteRef" id="n199.1src" href="#n199.1">33</a>. And as both hunting and higher industrial labour require much personal application,
neither can be well performed by slaves. Here extremes meet, if hunting and manufactures
are to be considered as extremes, which we are inclined to doubt, at least regarding
those tribes that have brought the art of hunting to a high perfection; such hunting
probably supposes more development of cerebral power than the lowest stage of agriculture<a class="noteRef" id="n199.2src" href="#n199.2">34</a>. But there is a difference between hunting and manufacturing nations. In manufacturing
countries, besides the higher kinds of labour, there are also many sorts of ruder
work to be done, that can be done by slaves as well. Moreover, slavery among a manufacturing
nation may date from a former period and have passed into the laws and customs; then
social life is based upon it; and so it remains for a long time after its economic
basis has fallen. Slavery in such cases, by a gradual mitigation, is made to agree
with changed economic conditions: the slave is given a proportionate share in the
produce of his labour; he is allowed to buy his freedom by means of his savings; or
his obligations are restricted to fixed tributes and services, and so the slave becomes
a serf<a class="noteRef" id="n199.3src" href="#n199.3">35</a>. But the Australians and other hunting tribes have not probably ever done anything
but hunting; and so neither present wants induce them to make slaves, nor do the traditions
of the past maintain slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n199.4src" href="#n199.4">36</a>. We may add, that supervision of the work of a hunting slave would be nearly impossible.
An agricultural slave can work in the presence of and surveyed by his master; but
hunting requires rather independent action.
</p>
<p>So slaves cannot be employed in hunting. They might, however, be set to do women’s
work, <i>i.e.</i> “erecting habitations, collecting fuel and water, carrying burdens, procuring roots
and delicacies of various kinds, making baskets for cooking roots and other <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>purposes, preparing food, and attending to the children”<a class="noteRef" id="n200.1src" href="#n200.1">37</a>. But, first, nomadic life and the requirements of the work would, in this case too,
very much facilitate the escape of the slave, the more so, as the slaves, when the
men are engaged in hunting, would be under the supervision of the women only. Moreover,
the men are not likely to take the pains of procuring slaves for the sole benefit
of their wives. We must also take into consideration, that these small tribes are
very much in need of the forces of every man in hunting and still more in warfare;
therefore an able-bodied boy will be brought up to be a hunter and warrior, rather
than given to the women as a slave. And finally, where war is frequent, such slaves,
not being able to fight, would soon be eliminated in the struggle for life, whereas
women are often spared because they are women<a class="noteRef" id="n200.2src" href="#n200.2">38</a>. Therefore it is only among tribes which either live in peaceful surroundings, or
are so powerful as not to have to fear their neighbours very much, that men performing
women’s work are to be found. Crantz speaks of a young Greenlander who was unable
to navigate, because when a child he had been taken too much care of by his mother.
“This man was employed by other Greenlanders like a maid-servant, performing all female
labour, in which he excelled”<a class="noteRef" id="n200.3src" href="#n200.3">39</a>. Among the Central Eskimos, according to Boas, “cripples who are unable to hunt do
the same kind of work as women”<a class="noteRef" id="n200.4src" href="#n200.4">40</a>. Tanner tells us of an Ojibway, who behaved entirely as a woman, and was kept as
a wife by another Ojibway. He excelled in female labour, which he had performed all
his life. Such men, according to Tanner, are found among all Indian tribes; they are
called <i>agokwa</i><a class="noteRef" id="n200.5src" href="#n200.5">41</a>. But in all these cases the men who perform female labour are not slaves. Crantz’s
young Greenlander probably was glad to earn his livelihood in this way. Domestic labour
among the Greenlanders is not generally wanted. Widows and orphans are sometimes taken
as servants; but this is done rather as a favour; <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>for else they would have to starve<a class="noteRef" id="n201.1src" href="#n201.1">42</a>. Among the Central Eskimos only those who are unable to hunt do the same work as
women; a man able to hunt will never be compelled to do female work. And the men of
Tanner’s narrative are entirely treated as women and somehow perform the sexual functions
of wives; the performing of domestic labour only would not probably be sufficient
for them to get their subsistence<a class="noteRef" id="n201.2src" href="#n201.2">43</a>. Only where either peaceful surroundings or a fighting power much superior to that
of the neighbours makes the existence of men performing female labour possible, and
where at the same time female labour is so much valued that the more labourers can
be got to do it the better, can there be male slaves performing women’s work<a class="noteRef" id="n201.3src" href="#n201.3">44</a>. Whether these requirements are fulfilled in any of our positive cases, will appear
from our investigation of these cases.
</p>
<p>The non-existence of slavery among most hunters and fishers now being accounted for,
we shall proceed to an inquiry into the causes of the existence of slavery among 18
hunting and fishing tribes.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="s2.2.2" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd32e606">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 2.</span> <i>The slave-keeping tribes of the Pacific Coast of North America.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Going on to account for our 18 positive cases, we may remark in the first place, that
what we have said about the causes preventing the existence of slavery, applies much
more to hunters than to fishers. Fishers are not necessarily so nomadic as hunters;
and where a sedentary life prevails, there is more domestic work to be done, and the
slaves cannot so easily escape. Moreover it is not so very difficult to control a
fishing slave, who is in the same boat with the master. The slave may also be used
to row the boat. Therefore it may be of some use to inquire, how many hunting and
how many fishing tribes <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>are to be found among our positive and negative cases. Fishing in our sense includes
the killing of water-animals besides fish: whales, seals, etc. Where a tribe lives
by hunting and fishing, we shall call it a hunting or a fishing tribe, according to
the predominating mode of subsistence.
</p>
<p>One difficulty arises here. Some tribes, especially Australian, subsist largely on
wild fruits, roots, berries, grasses, etc., shell-fish and lower land-animals, such
as beetles, lizards, rats, snakes, etc.; so that neither hunting in the true sense
nor fishing prevails<a class="noteRef" id="n202.1src" href="#n202.1">45</a>. For our purpose it will be most convenient to classify them under the head of hunters;
for the peculiar features of fishing tribes which we have enumerated: fixed habitations,
easy supervision of the work of slaves, drudgery such as rowing, are not found among
them. Moreover, the gathering of wild-growing vegetable food and the catching of the
lower animals, in Australia too, are chiefly incumbent on women, whereas the men hunt;
so the division of labour is the same as among other hunters regarding the quality
of the work of each sex; only the quantity of male labour is less and of female labour
greater here.
</p>
<p>Of our positive cases the following are hunters: some tribes about Puget Sound, Atnas,
Similkameem, Abipones, Tehuelches. The rest are fishers.
</p>
<p>Of our negative cases the following are fishers: Eskimos (9 tribes), Hupas, Fuegians,
Southern Nicobarese, Tuski, Ghiliaks, Koryakes. The rest are hunters, with the exception
of the Chepewyans, of whom Bancroft says: “Their food consists mostly of fish and
reindeer, the latter being easily taken in snares. Much of their land is barren, but
with sufficient vegetation to support numerous herds of reindeer, and fish abound
in their lakes and streams”<a class="noteRef" id="n202.2src" href="#n202.2">46</a>. So we are not able to ascertain whether hunting or fishing predominates among the
Chepewyans.
</p>
<p>We see that 5 hunting and 14 fishing tribes have slaves; 54 hunting and 15 fishing
tribes have no slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n202.3src" href="#n202.3">47</a>. In other words: <i>of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>hunting tribes 8½ per cent., of the fishing tribes 48 per cent. have slaves</i>.
</p>
<p>We may say now, that hunting is very unfavourable, and fishing not nearly so much
so, to the existence of slavery. But it remains to be explained, why a few hunting
tribes keep slaves, and why among the fishers the tribes with and without slaves are
nearly equally divided.
</p>
<p>Now it is worth noticing, that the great majority of our positive cases (all except
the Abipones, Tehuelches and Kamchadales) belong to one geographical group: they all
live on or near the Pacific Coast of North America, from Behring Strait to the Northern
boundary of California. Therefore we may suppose that the existence of slavery among
all these tribes is due to the same or nearly the same causes; and a survey of the
economic state of this group will probably enable us to find these causes. We shall
examine then, whether slavery among the three tribes outside this group can be accounted
for by the same causes, or if special causes are at work there.
</p>
<p>The circumstances that may be considered favouring the existence of slavery on the
Pacific Coast are the following:
</p>
<p>1º <i>Abundance of food.</i> The Aleuts eat only the best parts of the dried fish; the rest is thrown away<a class="noteRef" id="n203.1src" href="#n203.1">48</a>. Bancroft tells us that “although game is plentiful, the Haidas are not a race of
hunters, but derive their food chiefly from the innumerable multitude of fish and
sea animals, which, each variety in its season, fill the coast waters”<a class="noteRef" id="n203.2src" href="#n203.2">49</a>. The Tacullies, “are able to procure food with but little labour”<a class="noteRef" id="n203.3src" href="#n203.3">50</a>. Our informant also speaks of the “abundant natural supplies in ocean, stream, and
forest” of the Puget Sound Indians<a class="noteRef" id="n203.4src" href="#n203.4">51</a>. The Tlinkits, according to Holmberg, do not take great pains to secure their food;
the ebbing tide leaves a multitude of sea-animals ashore, which they can gather without
difficulty<a class="noteRef" id="n203.5src" href="#n203.5">52</a>. Kane remarks: “Salmon is almost the only food used by the Indians on the Lower Columbia
River, the two months’ fishing affording a sufficient supply to last them the whole
year round”<a class="noteRef" id="n203.6src" href="#n203.6">53</a>. About the tribes <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>of W. Washington and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon Gibbs remarks: “With all these sources of subsistence,
the greater part of which is afforded spontaneously by the land or water, nothing
but indolence or want of thrift could lead to want among a population even greater
than we have reason to believe at any time inhabited this district”<a class="noteRef" id="n204.1src" href="#n204.1">54</a>. The salmon fishery “has always been the chief and an inexhaustible source of food
for the Chinooks, who, although skilful fishermen, have not been obliged to invent
a great variety of methods or implements for the capture of the salmon, which rarely
if ever have failed them”<a class="noteRef" id="n204.2src" href="#n204.2">55</a>. The <span class="corr" id="xd32e13351" title="Source: Aths">Ahts</span> also, in Jewitt’s time, could procure an immense quantity of salmon with the greatest
facility<a class="noteRef" id="n204.3src" href="#n204.3">56</a>. Several other tribes on the Pacific Coast have fixed habitations and live together
in large groups, as we soon shall see; therefore amongst them too food must be abundant,
though this is not explicitly stated.
</p>
<p>The consequence is, that the produce of labour exceeds the primary wants of the labourer
much more than for instance in Australia, and the use of slaves is greater.
</p>
<p>2º. Most of these tribes <i>live chiefly by fishing</i> (see above). Moreover, there is a great <i>variety of food</i>. The Koniagas catch salmon, haddock, whales, seals, deer, reindeer, waterfowls, a
small white fish and grizzly bears<a class="noteRef" id="n204.4src" href="#n204.4">57</a>. The Tlinkits eat fish, various kinds of meat and plants, and shell-fish; formerly
they also killed whales<a class="noteRef" id="n204.5src" href="#n204.5">58</a>. The Haidas have abundance of game and fish. They eat also birds, and various kinds
of vegetables. Shell-fish are gathered by the women<a class="noteRef" id="n204.6src" href="#n204.6">59</a>. Of some tribes about Puget Sound we are told: “Fish is their chief dependence, though
game is taken in much larger quantities than by the Nootkas”<a class="noteRef" id="n204.7src" href="#n204.7">60</a>. The Ahts eat fish, roots and berries, and hunt the deer<a class="noteRef" id="n204.8src" href="#n204.8">61</a>. The Tacullies eat fish (chiefly salmon), herbs and berries and small game<a class="noteRef" id="n204.9src" href="#n204.9">62</a>. The Similkameem eat fresh and dried game of all kinds, the seed of the sunflower,
various roots, edible fungi, berries, wild onions<a class="noteRef" id="n204.10src" href="#n204.10">63</a>. The tribes of W. Washington <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon live on fish, roots, berries and a little game. “The roots used are
numerous.” “Besides the salmon sturgeon is taken in the Columbia, and a variety of
other fish.” Seals and whales are also occasionally killed. “Shell-fish in great variety
exist in the bays and on the coast”<a class="noteRef" id="n205.1src" href="#n205.1">64</a>. The basis of the Chinooks’ food is salmon; but besides this they eat sturgeon, wild-fowl,
deer, rabbits, nuts, berries, wild fruits and roots<a class="noteRef" id="n205.2src" href="#n205.2">65</a>.
</p>
<p>We do not attach very much importance to this circumstance; for even the Australians
have a great variety of food, and yet they are poorly off<a class="noteRef" id="n205.3src" href="#n205.3">66</a>. But together with the other causes it may have some influence; for where various
kinds of food are available, there is a good chance, that the procuring of one or
more of them will be a work fit to be performed by slaves.
</p>
<p>3º. They generally have <i>fixed habitations</i> and live in <i>rather large groups</i>; they are enabled to do so by <i>preserving food</i> for winter use. The Koniagas “build two kinds of houses; one a large, winter village
residence, … and the other a summer hunting hut.… Their winter houses are very large,
accommodating three or four families each.” “The <i>kashim</i> or public house of the Koniagas is built like their dwellings, and is capable of
accommodating three or four hundred people.” During the summer great quantities of
fish are dried for winter use, which they lay up in their houses<a class="noteRef" id="n205.4src" href="#n205.4">67</a>. The Tlinkits during the winter dwell in villages, regularly built and consisting
of solidly constructed houses. The greater houses lodge up to 30 persons. “For winter
they dry large quantities of herring, roes, and the flesh of animals”<a class="noteRef" id="n205.5src" href="#n205.5">68</a>. Haida houses are similar to those of the Tlinkits, but larger, better constructed
and more richly ornamented. “Fish, when caught, are delivered to the women, whose
duty it is to prepare them for winter use by drying”<a class="noteRef" id="n205.6src" href="#n205.6">69</a>. Among the Nootkas “each tribe has several villages in favourable locations for fishing
at different seasons.” Each house accommodates many families. Fish and shell-fish
are preserved by <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>drying; some varieties of seaweed and lichens, as well as various roots, are regularly
laid up for winter use<a class="noteRef" id="n206.1src" href="#n206.1">70</a>. In Jewitt’s narrative mention is made of divisions of the Ahts, consisting of 500–1000
warriors. They used to preserve various kinds of fish for the winter<a class="noteRef" id="n206.2src" href="#n206.2">71</a>. In W. Washington and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon acorns, some kinds of berries, and especially
salmon and whaleblubber, are stored for winter use<a class="noteRef" id="n206.3src" href="#n206.3">72</a>. About Puget Sound “the rich and powerful build substantial houses”. “These houses
sometimes measure over one hundred feet in length, and are divided into rooms or pens,
each house accommodating many families.” “In the better class of houses, supplies
are neatly stored in baskets at the sides”<a class="noteRef" id="n206.4src" href="#n206.4">73</a>. “During a portion of every year the Tacullies dwell in villages.” “In April they
visit the lakes and take small fish; and after these fail, they return to their villages
and subsist upon the fish they have dried, and upon herbs and berries”<a class="noteRef" id="n206.5src" href="#n206.5">74</a>. The Chinooks, according to Bancroft, do not move about much for the purpose of obtaining
a supply of food. They have permanent winter dwellings. “Once taken, the salmon were
cleaned by the women, dried in the sun and smoked in the lodges; then they were sometimes
powdered fine between two stones before packing in skins or mats for winter use”.
Swan also states that they preserve fish and berries for the winter<a class="noteRef" id="n206.6src" href="#n206.6">75</a>. Similar accounts are given of the Similkameem<a class="noteRef" id="n206.7src" href="#n206.7">76</a>.
</p>
<p>These circumstances greatly tend to further the growth of slavery. A settled life
makes escape of the slaves more difficult<a class="noteRef" id="n206.8src" href="#n206.8">77</a>. Living in larger groups brings about a higher organization of freemen, and therefore
a greater coercive power of the tribe over its slaves. And the preserving of food
requires additional work; and this work is very fit to be performed by slaves, as
it does not require overmuch skill, and has to be done in or near the house, so that
supervision of the work is very easy. Moreover, the hope of partaking of the stored
food is a tie that binds the slave to his master’s house, in <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>much the same manner as a modern workman is bound by having a share in the insurance
fund of the factory.
</p>
<p>4º. <i>Trade and industry</i> are highly developed along the Pacific Coast. Kane speaks of the <i>ioquas</i>, “a small shell found at Cape Flattery, and only there, in great abundance. These
shells are used as money, and a great traffic is carried on among all the tribes by
means of them”<a class="noteRef" id="n207.1src" href="#n207.1">78</a>. Among the Aleuts “whalefishing is confined to certain families, and the spirit of
the craft descends from father to son”<a class="noteRef" id="n207.2src" href="#n207.2">79</a>. The Koniagas are “adapted to labour and commerce rather than to war and hunting”.
They make very good boats and men as well as women excel in divers trades. They got
slaves by means of exchange from other tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n207.3src" href="#n207.3">80</a>. Among the Tlinkits there are professional wood-carvers, smiths and silversmiths.
The women are very skilful in plaiting. Very good canoes are made. Formerly they hunted
whales with harpoons. Trade was already highly developed before the arrival of the
whites; they traded even with remote parts of the coast and with the tribes of the
interior. The trade in slaves was formerly carried on on a large scale<a class="noteRef" id="n207.4src" href="#n207.4">81</a>. The large and ingeniously built canoes of the Haidas are widely celebrated; they
often make them for sale. They have a standard of value: formerly slaves or pieces
of copper, now blankets. Their houses are richly ornamented. They are “noted for their
skill in the construction of their various implements, particularly for sculptures
in stone and ivory, in which they excel all the other tribes of Northern America”<a class="noteRef" id="n207.5src" href="#n207.5">82</a>. The Tsimshian formerly acted as middlemen in the slave-trade. The southern tribes
kidnapped or captured slaves, sold them to the Tsimshian, and these again to the Tlinkits
and interior Tinneh. “Each chief about Fort Simpson kept an artisan, whose business
it was to repair canoes, make masks, etc.”<a class="noteRef" id="n207.6src" href="#n207.6">83</a>. The Atnas “understand the art of working copper, and have commercial relations with
surrounding tribes”. They buy their slaves from the Koltschanes<a class="noteRef" id="n207.7src" href="#n207.7">84</a>. Gibbs states that in W. Washington <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon the Indians of the interior preserve some kinds of salmon, “which
after a stay in the fresh water have lost their superfluous oil, and these are often
actually traded to those Indians at the mouth of the river or on the Sound. The Dalles
was formerly a great depot for this commerce”. Some wild-growing roots “were formerly
a great article of trade with the interior”. The slave-trade is carried on here too.
“Many of the slaves held here are … brought from California, where they were taken
by the warlike and predatory Indians of the plains, and sold to the Kallapuia and
Tsinuk.” “Many of them [the slaves] belong to distant tribes”<a class="noteRef" id="n208.1src" href="#n208.1">85</a>. The tribes about Puget Sound have canoes, beautifully made, painted and polished.
The houses of the rich are made of planks split from trees by means of bone wedges.
“In their barter between the different tribes, and in estimating their wealth, the
blanket is generally the unit of value, and the <i>hiaqua</i>, a long white shell obtained off Cape Flattery at a considerable depth, is also extensively
used for money, its value increasing with its length. A kind of annual fair for trading
purposes and festivities is held by the tribes of Puget Sound at Bajada Point.” “Slaves
are obtained by war and kidnapping, and are sold in large numbers to northern tribes”<a class="noteRef" id="n208.2src" href="#n208.2">86</a>. Of the Nootkas Bancroft says: “Trade in all their productions was carried on briskly
between the different Nootka tribes before the coming of the whites.” “The slave-trade
forms an important part of their commerce.” Harpooners are a privileged class<a class="noteRef" id="n208.3src" href="#n208.3">87</a>. The several divisions of the Ahts mutually exchange the fish that each of them catches.
They also sell mats and baskets manufactured by the women. According to Jewitt’s narrative,
they made very good canoes. A kind of shell, strung upon threads, formed a circulating
medium among them, five fathoms of it being the price of a slave, their most valuable
species of property. “The trade of most of the other tribes with Nootka was principally
train-oil, seal or whale’s blubber, fish fresh or dried, herring or salmon spawn,
clams and mussels, and the yama, a species of fruit which is pressed and dried, cloth,
sea-otter skins, and slaves”<a class="noteRef" id="n208.4src" href="#n208.4">88</a>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>Among the Makah (a Nootka tribe) the whale-oil “is used as an article of food as well
as for trade.… The Makah were till lately in the habit of purchasing oil from the
Nittinat also, and have traded in a single season, it is said, as much as 30,000 gallons.”
A division into different trades also exists among them. “A portion of them only attain
the dignity of whalers, a second class devote themselves to halibut, and a third to
salmon and inferior fish, the occupations being kept distinct, at least, in a great
measure”<a class="noteRef" id="n209.1src" href="#n209.1">89</a>. Among the Tacullies <i>hiaqua</i> shells up to 1810 were the circulating medium of the country<a class="noteRef" id="n209.2src" href="#n209.2">90</a>. The Chinooks, says Bancroft, “were always a commercial rather than a warlike people,
and are excelled by none in their shrewdness in bargaining. Before the arrival of
the Europeans they repaired annually to the region of the Cascades and Dalles, where
they met the tribes of the interior, with whom they exchanged their few articles of
trade—fish, oil, shell and Wapato—for the skins, roots and grasses of their eastern
neighbours.” “Their original currency or standard of value was the <i>hiaqua</i> shell.” They obtain their slaves “by war, or more commonly by trade”. According to
Swan, the Chinooks “manage, during the course of the winter, to make a great many
articles, which are disposed of to the whites”. A species of small shell passes as
money among them. “Their slaves are purchased from the Northern Indians, and are either
stolen or captives of war, and were regularly brought down and sold to the southern
tribes”<a class="noteRef" id="n209.3src" href="#n209.3">91</a>.
</p>
<p>This development of trade and industry furthers the growth of slavery in several ways:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> The slave-trade facilitates the keeping of slaves. Prisoners of war usually belong
to a neighbouring tribe; they have much more opportunity to escape to their native
country than purchased slaves, who have been transported from a great distance. The
latter, if escaping from their masters, would instantly be recaptured by some other
slave-keeping tribe of the Pacific Coast. So among the Nootkas “a runaway slave is
generally seized and resold by the first tribe he meets”<a class="noteRef" id="n209.4src" href="#n209.4">92</a>. We can <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>therefore easily understand why the Koniagas did not keep full-grown captive men as
slaves, but acquired their male slaves by means of exchange<a class="noteRef" id="n210.1src" href="#n210.1">93</a>. Similarly, a chief of the Cowitchins (near Vancouver Island), according to Kane,
“took many captives, whom he usually sold to the tribes further north, thus diminishing
their chance of escaping back through a hostile country to their own people”<a class="noteRef" id="n210.2src" href="#n210.2">94</a>.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Where the fishing implements are brought to a high perfection (canoes, nets, harpoons),
fishing becomes more remunerative; the produce of a fishing slave’s labour exceeds
his primary wants more than where fishing is carried on in a ruder manner.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> The more the freemen devote themselves to trade and industry, the more need there
is for slaves to do the ruder work (fishing, rowing, cooking, etc.). The trade itself
may also require menial work: carrying goods or rowing boats on commercial journeys,
etc.<a class="noteRef" id="n210.3src" href="#n210.3">95</a>.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Another effect of intertribal trade, together with a settled life and abundance of
food, is probably this, that these tribes are not so warlike as most hunters. So they
need not employ all available forces in warfare; they can afford to keep male slaves
who do not fight. We have seen that the Koniagas are “adapted to labour and commerce
rather than to war and hunting”, and that the Chinooks “were always a commercial rather
than a warlike people”. Regarding the other tribes it is not clearly stated, whether
war is very frequent<a class="noteRef" id="n210.4src" href="#n210.4">96</a>; but our impression, on perusing the ethnographical literature, is, that it is not
nearly so frequent as among the Sioux, Ojibways, and similar tribes.
</p>
<p>5º. <i>Property and wealth</i> are also highly developed. Schmoller remarks: “We know now, that there are some instances
of settled hunting and fishing tribes with villages, with some development of the
means of conveyance, with dog-sledges, reindeer, <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>etc., with a certain social organization of the chase and fishery, with ornaments
and slaves, with rich and poor people; such is the case in Northern California, in
Northern Asia, in Kamchatka”<a class="noteRef" id="n211.1src" href="#n211.1">97</a>. Among the Koniagas “when an individual becomes ambitious of popularity, a feast
is given”. A man’s wealth, among them, formerly depended on the number of sea-otter
skins he owned<a class="noteRef" id="n211.2src" href="#n211.2">98</a>. Among the Tlinkits private property comprises clothes, weapons, implements, hunting
territories and roads of commerce. Nobility depends on wealth rather than on birth<a class="noteRef" id="n211.3src" href="#n211.3">99</a>. Of the Haidas Bancroft says: “Rank and power depend greatly upon wealth, which consists
of implements, wives and slaves. Admission to alliance with medicine-men, whose influence
is greatest in the tribe, can only be gained by sacrifice of private property”. Swan
speaks of wooden pillars, placed before the houses of the rich. They are elaborately
carved at a cost of hundreds of blankets, and fetch up to 1000 dollars. Only the very
rich are able to purchase them<a class="noteRef" id="n211.4src" href="#n211.4">100</a>. Kane speaks of a Cowitchin chief who “possessed much of what is considered wealth
amongst the Indians, and it gradually accumulated from tributes which he exacted from
his people. On his possessions reaching a certain amount, it is customary to make
a great feast, to which all contribute. The neighbouring chiefs with whom he is in
amity are invited, and at the conclusion of the entertainment, he distributes all
he has collected since the last feast, perhaps three or four years preceding, among
his guests as presents. The amount of property thus collected and given away by a
chief is sometimes very considerable. I have heard of one possessing as many as twelve
bales of blankets, from twenty to thirty guns, with numberless pots, kettles, and
pans, knives, and other articles of cutlery, and great quantities of beads, and other
trinkets, as well as numerous beautiful Chinese boxes, which find their way here from
the Sandwich Islands. The object in thus giving his treasures away is to add to his
own importance in the eyes of others, his own people often boasting of how much their
chief had given away, and exhibiting with pride such things as they had received themselves
from <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>him”<a class="noteRef" id="n212.1src" href="#n212.1">101</a>. Among the Nootkas “private wealth consists of boats and implements for obtaining
food, domestic utensils, slaves, and blankets”. “The accumulation of property beyond
the necessities of life is only considered desirable for the purpose of distributing
it in presents on great feast-days, and thereby acquiring a reputation for wealth
and liberality”<a class="noteRef" id="n212.2src" href="#n212.2">102</a>. In Jewitt’s narrative it is stated, that among the Ahts the king is obliged to support
his dignity by making frequent entertainments, otherwise he would not be considered
as conducting himself like a king, and would be no more thought of than a common man<a class="noteRef" id="n212.3src" href="#n212.3">103</a>. A wealthy Fish Indian may also win renown by giving away or destroying property<a class="noteRef" id="n212.4src" href="#n212.4">104</a>. Boas, describing the Kwakiutl Indians, speaks of “the method of acquiring rank.
This is done by means of the potlatch, or the distribution of property. The underlying
principle is that of the interest-bearing investment of property”. He gives an elaborate
account of this institution<a class="noteRef" id="n212.5src" href="#n212.5">105</a>. Among the Makah “the larger class of canoes generally belong to a single individual
and he receives a proportionate share of the booty from the crew”<a class="noteRef" id="n212.6src" href="#n212.6">106</a>. Among the Tacullies “any person may become a <i>miuty</i> or chief who will occasionally provide a village feast”<a class="noteRef" id="n212.7src" href="#n212.7">107</a>. Of the tribes of W. Washington and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon Gibbs says: “Wealth gives a certain
power among them, and influence is purchased by its lavish distribution.” They have
pretty clear ideas about the right of property in houses and goods. The men own property
distinct from their wives. The husband has his own blankets, the wife her mats and
baskets<a class="noteRef" id="n212.8src" href="#n212.8">108</a>. Bancroft tells us of the Puget Sound Indians: “I find no evidence of hereditary
rank or caste except as wealth is sometimes inherited”<a class="noteRef" id="n212.9src" href="#n212.9">109</a>. Among the Chinooks “individuals were protected in their right to personal property,
such as slaves, canoes, and implements”. Each village was ruled by a chief “either
hereditary or selected for his wealth and popularity”<a class="noteRef" id="n212.10src" href="#n212.10">110</a>.
</p>
<p>The effects of this development of property and wealth are:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Social status depending mainly upon wealth, a slave may be a good hunter or fisher
and valued as such, and yet be despised as a penniless fellow.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>b.</i> The accumulation of property beyond the necessities of life requires more labour
than would otherwise be wanted. Moreover, slaves are the more desired, as the keeping
of many slaves is indicative of wealth and therefore honourable. We may quote here
Kane’s account of a chief of the Pacific Coast, “who having erected a colossal idol
of wood, sacrificed five slaves to it, barbarously murdering them at its base, and
asking in a boasting manner who amongst them could afford to kill so many slaves”.
And Holmberg remarks that among the Tlinkits the consideration which the nobles enjoy
depends only on their wealth, <i>i.e.</i> on the number of the slaves they own<a class="noteRef" id="n213.1src" href="#n213.1">111</a>.
</p>
<p>The five causes we have enumerated here are not at work independently of each other.
Abundance of food enables a tribe to have fixed habitations, to live in larger groups,
to preserve food. Any greater development of trade and industry would be impossible
if food were not abundant; for else all time and energy would be occupied by the seeking
of food; and a settled life tends greatly to further the growth of industry. Wealth
would scarcely exist if there were no trade and industry. The industrial development
again facilitates the procuring of food. What is the primary cause of this relatively
high state of economic life is not easy to say, and an investigation into this matter
falls beyond the scope of the present volume.
</p>
<p>It must also be remembered, that this economic state is not only the cause, but also
to some extent the effect of slavery.
</p>
<p>The development of trade and industry, of property and wealth, is undoubtedly much
furthered by slavery. By imposing the ruder work upon slaves, the slave-owner can
give more of his time and mind to trade and industry. “Leisure” as Bagehot remarks
“is the great need of early societies, and slaves only can give men leisure”<a class="noteRef" id="n213.2src" href="#n213.2">112</a>. And that the keeping of slaves furthers the accumulation of wealth need hardly be
said. The slave-trade, which enriches the traders, is even quite impossible where
slavery does not exist. Hence we may infer that slavery must already have existed
here at a somewhat lower stage of economic life.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a circumstance tending to accelerate <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>the growth of slavery on the Pacific Coast. These tribes form a somewhat homogeneous
group, and have much intercourse with each other. So we may suppose that some of them,
that were not yet in such an economic state as spontaneously to invent slavery, have
begun to keep slaves, imitating what they saw among their neighbours; the more so,
as the slave-trade made this very easy. For our group is not quite homogeneous. The
picture we gave of their highly developed economic life does not equally apply to
all these tribes. The summer and winter dwellings of the Similkameem are rather primitive.
They depend on hunting for a large portion of their food. Trade and industry, property
and wealth are not mentioned; it is only stated that at a later period they had horses
and cattle<a class="noteRef" id="n214.1src" href="#n214.1">113</a>. Niblack tells us that the Tsimshian sold slaves to the Tlinkits and interior Tinneh;
but “the last-named had no hereditary slaves, getting their supply from the coast”<a class="noteRef" id="n214.2src" href="#n214.2">114</a>. No more particulars are given; but we may suppose that among these interior Tinneh
slavery existed in a rather embryonic state, and would not have existed at all but
for the slave-trade. The early ethnologists overrated the influence of imitation and
derivation of social institutions; but we must not fall into the other extreme and
underrate it. An institution may be derived and thereby its growth accelerated, of
course within restricted limits.
</p>
<p>If the information we have got on the <i>work imposed on slaves</i> were more complete, it would perhaps have been better first to survey this information,
and thence to infer what place slavery occupies among the tribes of the Pacific Coast.
But the statements of our ethnographers regarding slave labour are rather incomplete.
A survey of them may, however, be of some use. In the first place it will be seen,
whether they can be brought to agree with the exposition given above of the causes
of slavery; and, secondly, our survey will perhaps provide us with new valuable data,
which may give us a clearer understanding of the significance of slavery on the Pacific
Coast of North America.
</p>
<p>The occupations of slaves mentioned by our ethnographers are the following:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>1º. In a few cases the <i>slaves strengthen their master’s force in warfare</i>. Aleut slaves always accompany their masters, and have to protect them<a class="noteRef" id="n215.1src" href="#n215.1">115</a>. “Kotzebue says that a rich man [among the Tlinkits] purchases male and female slaves,
who must labour and fish for him, and strengthen his force when he is engaged in warfare”<a class="noteRef" id="n215.2src" href="#n215.2">116</a>. We may suppose that the last part of this sentence applies to male slaves only.
Tsimshian slaves guard the house, when the master is absent<a class="noteRef" id="n215.3src" href="#n215.3">117</a>. Among the Ahts, the slaves were obliged to attend their masters in war and to fight
for them<a class="noteRef" id="n215.4src" href="#n215.4">118</a>.
</p>
<p>This military function of slavery, as we shall see, also exists among several pastoral
and agricultural peoples. The industrial part of society, in such cases, is not quite
differentiated from the military part. As for the Tlinkits, Tsimshian and Ahts, the
employing of slaves for protecting the master or his property is facilitated by the
slave-trade: a purchased slave, brought from a great distance, may be made to fight,
where it would not be safe to employ in warfare a slave captured from a neighbouring
tribe; for the latter will probably be much inclined to go over to the enemies, who
often are his own kindred. But the example of the Aleuts, whose slaves are prisoners
of war and their descendants<a class="noteRef" id="n215.5src" href="#n215.5">119</a>, shows that even captive slaves may be employed in warfare. We shall not very much
wonder at this, if we take into consideration, that prisoners of war are sometimes
soon forgotten, and even repelled, by their former countrymen. So “if a Mojave is
taken prisoner he is forever discarded in his own nation, and should he return his
mother even will not own him”<a class="noteRef" id="n215.6src" href="#n215.6">120</a>. The expectation of such treatment may induce captive slaves to fight on their masters’
side against their own tribesmen rather than join the latter.
</p>
<p>2º. Slaves are sometimes employed in <i>hunting, fishing and work connected with fishing</i>, such as rowing, etc. From a statement of Dunn’s, quoted by Niblack, we learn that
at Fort Simpson, British Columbia (in the country of the Tsimshian), <span class="corr" id="xd32e13669" title="Not in source">“</span>a full-grown athletic slave, who is a good hunter, will fetch nine blankets, a gun,
a quantity of powder and ball, a couple <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>of dressed elk skins, tobacco, vermilion paint, a flat file, and other little articles”<a class="noteRef" id="n216.1src" href="#n216.1">121</a>. And Boas tells us, that Tsimshian slaves row the boats, bring the killed seals to
land, and cook them<a class="noteRef" id="n216.2src" href="#n216.2">122</a>. Tlinkit slaves, as it appears from Kotzebue’s above-quoted statement, must fish
for their masters. Among the Nootkas “the common business of fishing for ordinary
sustenance is carried on by slaves, or the lower class of people; while the more noble
occupation of killing the whale and hunting the sea-otter is followed by none but
the chiefs and warriors”<a class="noteRef" id="n216.3src" href="#n216.3">123</a>. According to Jewitt’s narrative, Aht slaves had to supply their masters with fish.
The author, on his wedding an Aht girl, got two young male slaves presented to him
to assist him in fishing<a class="noteRef" id="n216.4src" href="#n216.4">124</a>.
</p>
<p>Dunn’s statement about hunting slaves is very valuable. It proves that hunting is
here no longer the chief and noble occupation of freemen. Among such people as for
instance the Ojibways a good hunter is held in high esteem, not bought at a high price
as a valuable slave<span id="xd32e13688"></span><a class="noteRef" id="n216.5src" href="#n216.5">125</a>. What we have said in the last paragraph about hunting not being fit to be performed
by slaves, is not impaired by this statement; for hunting among these traders is not
the most honoured occupation; moreover, the abundance of game along the Pacific Coast
makes it very easy; it does not require nearly so much skill and application as among
the Ojibways and similar tribes. This statement also contains a most striking refutation
of Bos’ assertion, that slavery here exists only as a reminiscence of a hypothetical
former agricultural state<a class="noteRef" id="n216.6src" href="#n216.6">126</a>. If this were true, there might be traces of an ancient slave system; slaves might
even still be kept by rich men as a luxury; but the slave’s ability in hunting would
not enter as a determining factor into his price. Slavery exists here in full vigour,
and is not in any way, as Bos will have it, foreign to the economic state in which
these tribes live<a class="noteRef" id="n216.7src" href="#n216.7">127</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>What Meares tells us of the Nootkas is also instructive. The drudgery for daily sustenance,
fishing, is left to the slaves; whereas the chiefs and warriors reserve to themselves
the less productive and (partly therefore) more noble occupation of killing whales
and sea-otters. It is remarkable that fishing is carried on by “the slaves or the
lower class of people”. Those who cannot afford to buy slaves must themselves perform
the drudgery that others leave to slaves. The formation of social classes among freemen
is furthered by slavery.
</p>
<p>3º. The slaves of the Ahts, in Jewitt’s time, were obliged to <i>make the canoes</i> and to <i>assist in building and repairing the houses</i><a class="noteRef" id="n217.1src" href="#n217.1">128</a>. This proves, that slavery among them discharged an important economic function.
</p>
<p>4º. We are often informed, that slaves do <i>domestic work</i>. Tsimshian slaves cook the killed seals and cut wood<a class="noteRef" id="n217.2src" href="#n217.2">129</a>. Among the Nootkas “women prepare the fish and game for winter use, cook, manufacture
cloth and clothing, and increase the stock of food by gathering berries and shell-fish;
and most of this work among the richer class is done by slaves”. Our informant speaks
also of “the hard labour required” from the slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n217.3src" href="#n217.3">130</a>. Among the Ahts, slaves, as Sproat tells us, serve the family. When a man of rank
is going to remove, the new house is prepared in advance by his slaves. According
to Jewitt’s narrative, “all the menial offices are performed by them, such as bringing
water, cutting wood, and a variety of others”. “The females are employed principally
in manufacturing cloth, in cooking, collecting berries, etc<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>”<a class="noteRef" id="n217.4src" href="#n217.4">131</a>. Among the Fish Indians old women and slaves prepare the food<a class="noteRef" id="n217.5src" href="#n217.5">132</a>. Chinook slaves “are obliged to perform all the drudgery for their masters.… But
the amount of the work connected with the Chinook household is never great”<a class="noteRef" id="n217.6src" href="#n217.6">133</a>. The last sentence here proves that “drudgery” means household work.
</p>
<p>Some general expressions we find on record with our ethnographers seem to bear the
same meaning. For instance, Tlinkit slaves, according to Kotzebue (quoted above),
must “labour” for their masters; and Niblack, evidently referring to <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>the same statement, says that “slaves did all the drudgery”<a class="noteRef" id="n218.1src" href="#n218.1">134</a>. The Tacullies use their slaves “as beasts of burden”, which perhaps also means imposing
household labour upon them<a class="noteRef" id="n218.2src" href="#n218.2">135</a>. Holmberg states that the Koniagas employed their slaves as labourers or servants<a class="noteRef" id="n218.3src" href="#n218.3">136</a>. And Niblack remarks about the Coast Indians of Southern Alaska and Northern British
Columbia in general: “When slavery was in vogue, this class performed all the menial
drudgery”<a class="noteRef" id="n218.4src" href="#n218.4">137</a>.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that slaves in so many cases are stated to perform household, <i>i.e.</i> female, labour. These statements are even more numerous than those about fishing
and similar work; so it would seem (we may not speak more positively, as our information
is rather incomplete), that household work is the chief occupation of slaves along
the Pacific Coast. Now it is easy to understand, that fixed habitations and the preserving
of food for winter use require a large amount of domestic labour. But this does not
solve the question, why slaves are employed for this work; why the men purchase or
capture slaves not for their own private use, but in order to relieve their wives
of a part of their task. In Australia women are overworked, and beaten into the bargain;
why are the men of the Pacific Coast so anxious to give the women assistance in their
work?
</p>
<p>It might be, that female labour is valued by the men, because articles of trade are
prepared by the women. Unfortunately the ethnographers most often content themselves
with remarking that a brisk trade is carried on, or that some tribe is commercial
rather than warlike, without specifying the articles of commerce. Yet a few statements
tend to verify our hypothesis. The articles of trade of the Chinooks before the arrival
of the Europeans were: fish, oil, shells, and Wapato. “The Wapato, a bulbous root,
compared by some to the potato and turnip, was the aboriginal staple, and was gathered
by women”<a class="noteRef" id="n218.5src" href="#n218.5">138</a>. Lewis and Clark also state that this bulb, which “is the great article of food,
and almost the staple article of commerce on the Columbia”, is collected chiefly by
the women<a class="noteRef" id="n218.6src" href="#n218.6">139</a>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>The Tlinkits export to the interior basket-work, dancing clothes, train-oil prepared
from the <i>ssag</i> (a kind of fish), a sort of cakes made of Alaria Esculenta (a sea-weed). The women
manufacture basket-work, dancing clothes, mocassins and other clothes. In the fishing
season they are from morning to night engaged in preparing the fish. In the autumn
they gather berries, bark, leaves and other vegetable by-meat; in other seasons they
gather shells and sea-urchins on the beach<a class="noteRef" id="n219.1src" href="#n219.1">140</a>. Here all articles of trade are products of female labour. Among the Ahts baskets
and mats, manufactured by the women, are sold; the women may keep the proceeds, and
also get a little portion of their husbands’ earnings. Our informant, speaking of
the several divisions of the Ahts mutually exchanging the fish that each of them catches,
probably also means fish prepared by the women<a class="noteRef" id="n219.2src" href="#n219.2">141</a>. In W. Washington and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon the <i>kamas</i>, a root which was “formerly a great article of trade with the interior”, is dug by
the women<a class="noteRef" id="n219.3src" href="#n219.3">142</a>. What articles are exported by the other tribes we do not know.
</p>
<p>There is another fact strengthening our hypothesis: women are often consulted in matters
of trade. Among the Tlinkits “the men rarely conclude a bargain without consulting
their wives”<a class="noteRef" id="n219.4src" href="#n219.4">143</a>. Nootka wives too “are consulted in matters of trade”<a class="noteRef" id="n219.5src" href="#n219.5">144</a>. About Puget Sound the females “are always consulted in matters of trade before a
bargain is closed”<a class="noteRef" id="n219.6src" href="#n219.6">145</a>. Chinook women “are consulted on all important matters”<a class="noteRef" id="n219.7src" href="#n219.7">146</a>, which matters, among these commercial people, necessarily include the trade. Among
the Haidas, the trade, in Jewitt’s time, was even principally managed by the women,
who were expert in making a bargain<a class="noteRef" id="n219.8src" href="#n219.8">147</a>.
</p>
<p>This need not, however, be the only cause; for women here enjoy a rather high position;
so it might be that the men wish to alleviate the task of their wives, quite apart
from the occupation of the latter in preparing the articles of commerce. Aleuts, if
not addicted to drinking, are good husbands, and help their wives in everything<a class="noteRef" id="n219.9src" href="#n219.9">148</a>. Among the Tlinkits, according to Krause, “woman’s position is not a bad one. She
is not the <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>slave of her husband; she has determinate rights, and her influence is considerable”;
and Bancroft remarks that “there are few savage nations, in which the sex have greater
influence or command greater respect”<a class="noteRef" id="n220.1src" href="#n220.1">149</a>. Nootka wives “seem to be nearly on terms of equality with their husbands, except
that they are excluded from some public feasts and ceremonies”<a class="noteRef" id="n220.2src" href="#n220.2">150</a>; and Sproat tells us that among the Ahts slaves only are prostituted; women are not
badly treated; a wife may leave her husband with the consent of her relatives<a class="noteRef" id="n220.3src" href="#n220.3">151</a>. Among the Koniagas, according to Holmberg, the women did not hold a subordinate
place as among other savage tribes of North America, but enjoyed high consideration<a class="noteRef" id="n220.4src" href="#n220.4">152</a>. In W. Washington and N.&nbsp;W. Oregon, according to Gibbs, “the condition of the woman
is that of slavery under any circumstances.” But the particulars he gives prove that
the women here are not so very badly off. In their councils “the women are present
at, and join in the deliberations, speaking in a low tone, their words being repeated
aloud by a reporter. On occasions of less ceremony, they sometimes address the audience
without any such intervention, and give their admonitions with a freedom of tongue
highly edifying. In a few instances, matrons of superior character, “strong minded
women”, have obtained an influence similar to that of chiefs.” The men own property
distinct from their wives. “He has his own blankets, she her mats and baskets, and
generally speaking her earnings belong to her, except those arising from prostitution,
which are her husband’s.” Sometimes “the courtship commences in this way—the girl
wishing a husband, and taking a straightforward mode of attracting one.” “The accession
of a new wife in the lodge very naturally produces jealousy and discord, and the first
often returns for a time in dudgeon to her friends, to be reclaimed by her husband
when he chooses, perhaps after propitiating her by some present”<a class="noteRef" id="n220.5src" href="#n220.5">153</a>. Yet the condition of women seems not to be quite as good as among the other tribes.
“A man sends his wife away, or sells her at his will.” “An Indian, perhaps, will not
let his favourite wife, but he looks upon his others, his sisters, daughters, <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>female relatives, and slaves, as a legitimate source of profit”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.1src" href="#n221.1">154</a>. But we must take into consideration, that Gibbs gives a general description of inland
tribes and coast tribes together. That among the latter the condition of women is
not so very bad, is proved by Bancroft’s statements about the tribes on Puget Sound
and Chinooks. About Puget Sound “women have all the work to do except hunting and
fishing, while their lords spend their time in idleness and gambling. Still the females
are not ill-treated; they acquire great influence in the tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.2src" href="#n221.2">155</a>. And among the Chinooks “work is equally divided between the sexes.… Their [women’s]
condition is by no means a hard one. It is among tribes that live by the chase or
by other means in which women can be of little service, that we find the sex most
oppressed and cruelly treated”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.3src" href="#n221.3">156</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> This statement is strengthened by Swan writing that “with these Indians the position
of the women is not so degraded as with the tribes of the Plains”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.4src" href="#n221.4">157</a>. The Tacullies “are fond of their wives, performing the most of the household drudgery
in order to relieve them”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.5src" href="#n221.5">158</a>. Mackenzie, speaking of an Indian tribe, probably related to the Atnahs on Fraser
River, amongst whom strangers are kept “in a state of awe and subjection,” states
that they live upon the products of the sea and rivers and are to be considered as
a “stationary people.” “Hence it is that the men engage in those toilsome employments,
which the tribes who support themselves by the chase leave entirely to the women”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.6src" href="#n221.6">159</a>.
</p>
<p>Our information, here again, is not very complete; but as far as it goes it tends
to prove that the condition of women on the Pacific Coast is not a bad one.
</p>
<p>This good condition of women here, as compared with for instance that of Australian
women, may for a great part be due to the settled life of these tribes. While the
men are on fishing, hunting, or trading expeditions, the women enjoy much liberty;
whereas Australian women are continually marching along with their husbands<a class="noteRef" id="n221.7src" href="#n221.7">160</a>. The men must also be aware <span class="pageNum" id="pb222a">[<a href="#pb222a">222</a>]</span>that domestic comfort, worth much in these cold regions, depends on the women. As
militarism does not prevail here to any great extent, women are not so much in need
of male protection. And village life makes conspiracy of women possible. So among
the Aleuts “a religious festival used to be held in December, at which all the women
of the village assembled by moonlight, and danced naked with masked faces, the men
being excluded under penalty of death”<a class="noteRef" id="n222.1src" href="#n222.1">161</a>. Last but not least, subsistence here is largely dependent on female labour. Lewis
and Clark remark: “Where the women can aid in procuring subsistence for the tribe,
they are treated with more equality, and their importance is proportioned to the share
which they take in that labour; while in countries where subsistence is chiefly procured
by the exertions of the men, the women are considered and treated as burdens. Thus,
among the Clatsops and Chinnooks, who live upon fish and roots, which the women are
equally expert with the men in procuring, the former have a rank and influence very
rarely found among Indians. The females are permitted to speak freely before the men,
to whom indeed they sometimes address themselves in a tone of authority. On many subjects
their judgments and opinions are respected, and in matters of trade, their advice
is generally asked and pursued. The labours of the family too, are shared almost equally”<a class="noteRef" id="n222.2src" href="#n222.2">162</a>.
</p>
<p>We have only enumerated some causes tending to bring about a good condition of women.
It is not the place here to expatiate upon this point any further. But it is worth
while to emphasize the fact itself, that women are on the whole well treated among
these tribes. A German writer, Dr. Grosse, has tried to prove, that among the “higher
hunters” (<i lang="de">höhere Jäger</i>) as well as among the “lower hunters” (<i lang="de">niedere Jäger</i>) <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>woman’s state is a bad one. As all our tribes belong to Grosse’s “higher hunters”<a class="noteRef" id="n223.1src" href="#n223.1">163</a>, we shall attempt to find out, why his conclusion is so different from ours. He quotes
several ethnographical statements, which are to afford a basis for his inference<a class="noteRef" id="n223.2src" href="#n223.2">164</a>. We shall examine whether this is a sound basis. Grosse does not always exactly specify
which tribe each quotation applies to; but as he most frequently quotes Bancroft,
we can easily find it out. He first quotes this statement of Bancroft’s about the
Shoshones: “The weaker sex of course do the hardest labour, and receive more blows
than kind words for their pains”<a class="noteRef" id="n223.3src" href="#n223.3">165</a>. But the very next sentence: “These people, in common with most nomadic nations,
have the barbarous custom of abandoning the old and infirm the moment they find them
an incumbrance,” shows that these Shoshones are not at all to be compared to the Tlinkits
and similar tribes; their mode of life is decidedly rude and little comfortable. Then
he refers to some passages of Bancroft’s, proving that unfaithfulness of the wife
is punished with death, whereas the husband has the right to prostitute his wife to
strangers. These passages apply to the Southern and Northern Californians as well
as to the Shoshones. But about the former it is also stated: “If a man ill-treated
his wife, her relations took her away, after paying back the value of her wedding
presents, and then married her to another”<a class="noteRef" id="n223.4src" href="#n223.4">166</a>. And of the Northern Californians we are told: “Among the Modocs polygamy prevails,
and the women have considerable privilege. The Hoopa adulterer loses one eye, the
adulteress is exempt from punishment”<a class="noteRef" id="n223.5src" href="#n223.5">167</a>. Moreover, “although the principal labour falls to the lot of the women, the men
sometimes assist in building the wigwam, or even in gathering acorns and roots”<a class="noteRef" id="n223.6src" href="#n223.6">168</a>. Another statement of Bancroft’s, quoted by Grosse, applies to the Chepewyans: “The
Northern Indian is master of his household. He marries without ceremony, and divorces
his wife at his pleasure. A man of forty buys or fights for a spouse of twelve, and
when tired of her whips her and sends her away”<a class="noteRef" id="n223.7src" href="#n223.7">169</a>. This statement is corroborated by a report of Hearne’s. But why Grosse calls <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>the Chepewyans “higher hunters” we do not understand. “Altogether they are pronounced
an inferior race”. “The Chepewyans inhabit huts of brush and portable skin tents”.
“Their weapons and their utensils are of the most primitive kind”<a class="noteRef" id="n224.1src" href="#n224.1">170</a>. The next quotation applies to the Kutchins, whose wives “are treated more like dogs
than human beings”. But this is only stated of the Tenan Kutchin, “people of the mountains,”
“a wild, ungovernable horde, their territory never yet having been invaded by white
people”. “The Kutcha Kutchin, “people of the lowland,” are cleaner and better mannered”.
And of these “better mannered” Kutchins Bancroft says: “The women perform all domestic
duties, and eat after the husband is satisfied; but the men paddle the boats, and
have even been known to carry their wives ashore, so that they might not wet their
feet”<a class="noteRef" id="n224.2src" href="#n224.2">171</a>. As for the Nootkas, women being “somewhat overworked” (Grosse does not mention that
among the richer class most female work is done by slaves), and excluded from some
public feasts, Grosse concludes that their state is a bad one. We have quoted above
some facts tending to prove the contrary. Then Grosse asserts that, according to Bancroft,
Haida husbands prostitute their wives for money. Bancroft, however, says literally:
“While jealousy is not entirely unknown, chastity appears to be so, as women who can
earn the greatest number of blankets win great admiration for themselves and high
position for their husbands”<a class="noteRef" id="n224.3src" href="#n224.3">172</a>; which is not exactly the same. The Tlinkits, according to Grosse, are the only<span id="xd32e13915"></span> unaccountable exception to his general rule. Finally he attempts to prove, that the
alleged supremacy of women in Kamchatka does not signify so very much; but that Kamchadale
women are badly treated, even he does not assert.
</p>
<p>What remains now of Grosse’s evidence? Tlinkit and Kamchadale women he himself admits
not to be badly off. What he says of Nootkas and Haidas proves very little. About
the Northern and Southern Californians we have got statements that impair Grosse’s
argument very much. Only among the Shoshones, Chepewyans, and Tenan Kutchin is the
state of women decidedly bad; but these are not on a level with the <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>other tribes; they are migratory and little advanced in the arts of life. And of the
Tenan Kutchin we know very little, “their territory never yet having been invaded
by white people”<a class="noteRef" id="n225.1src" href="#n225.1">173</a>.
</p>
<p>Grosse derives most of his evidence from Bancroft’s book; but he evidently has not
paid attention to all the data given by Bancroft, which relate to the condition of
women. Sometimes he quotes one sentence, where two successive sentences taken together
would give quite another view of the matter. Several statements of Bancroft’s (such
as about the tribes on Puget Sound, Chinooks, Tacullies) he omits altogether; whereas
just the tribes of the N.&nbsp;W. Coast of North America are, according to him, among the
most typical “higher hunters”<a class="noteRef" id="n225.2src" href="#n225.2">174</a>. And he can only give a semblance of truth to his inference by classifying under
“higher hunters” Shoshones and similar tribes, which are not more advanced in the
arts of life than some Australians, and decidedly much less than the Eskimos and Aleuts
whom he calls “lower hunters”.
</p>
<p>Returning to our chief subject, we may remark, that our survey of slave labour leads
to the same conclusion we arrived at before, viz. that the preserving of food, a settled
life, and the high development of trade, industry and wealth, are the main causes
which have made slavery so largely prevalent here. As additional causes we may now
name the high position of women, which induces the men to relieve them of a part of
their work by giving them the help of slaves; and, in a few cases, the want of fighting
men, who are to strengthen their masters’ force in warfare.
</p>
<p>We shall now briefly examine, which are the causes of slavery among the slave-keeping
hunters and fishers outside the Pacific Coast.
</p>
<p>Among the Abipones the function of slavery was beyond any doubt reinforcement of the
tribe. The slaves were very leniently treated. “I know of many people” says Dobrizhoffer,
“who, being released by their friends and brought back to their native country, voluntarily
returned to their masters, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>Abipones, whom they follow in their hunting and fighting expeditions; though Spaniards
themselves, they do not hesitate to stain their hands with Spanish blood.” “The liberty
to go where they like, the abundance of food and clothing procured without any labour,
the <span class="corr" id="xd32e13935" title="Source: possesion">possession</span> of many horses, the freedom to idle and run into debauchery, the lawless impunity
they enjoy, bind the Spanish captives so much to the Abipones, that they prefer their
captivity to liberty”. “The Abipones, though considering polygamy allowed, very seldom
take several wives at a time; the captives do not often content themselves with one
wife, but marry as many female prisoners, Spanish or Indian, as they can”<a class="noteRef" id="n226.1src" href="#n226.1">175</a>.
</p>
<p>The reason for taking prisoners here was the same as among the Iroquois and similar
tribes, where they were adopted; with this sole difference, that the Abipones seem
to have had a sexual aversion (that cannot be accounted for here) to all men and women
outside their own nation; therefore they did not adopt their prisoners, nor had they
any sexual intercourse with them. Slavery as a system of labour did not exist here.
</p>
<p>As for their economic life, this was much inferior to that on the Pacific Coast of
North America. They subsisted on the spontaneous products of nature and on game. Food
was abundant; yet their mode of life required frequent migrations. All their journeys
were performed on horseback<a class="noteRef" id="n226.2src" href="#n226.2">176</a>.
</p>
<p>The information we get about the Tehuelches is very incomplete. Falkner states, that
the female relatives of the cacique have slaves, who perform most of their work<a class="noteRef" id="n226.3src" href="#n226.3">177</a>.
</p>
<p>In Kamchatka slaves were employed for various domestic labours, such as fetching wood,
feeding the dogs, making axes and knives from stone and bone<a class="noteRef" id="n226.4src" href="#n226.4">178</a>. The Kamchadales were not so far advanced in the arts of life as the tribes of the
Pacific Coast of North America. They think only of the present, says Steller; they
are not ambitious to become rich. They do not like to work more than is needed for
their own and their families’ subsistence. “When they have got as much as they think
to be sufficient, they do not collect any more food; they would not even do so, if
the fish came on land and the animals <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>into their dwellings”. A rather brisk trade was, however, carried on by them and was
largely dependent on female labour<a class="noteRef" id="n227.1src" href="#n227.1">179</a>. They also had fixed habitations<a class="noteRef" id="n227.2src" href="#n227.2">180</a>.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the tribes of the Pacific Coast, we concluded that slavery must have already
existed among them at a somewhat lower stage of economic life. The Kamchadales afford
a proof of this. They were not so far advanced in the arts of life as the tribes of
the Pacific Coast; yet slavery already existed among them, though it does not seem
to have prevailed here to any great extent.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the last paragraph we have shown that in the economic and social life of the slave-keeping
hunters and fishers (especially those on the Pacific Coast of North America) there
are some features which account for the existence of slavery. But there is still something
wanting in our argument. It might be that the circumstances which we have called causes
of slavery were equally found among the hunting and fishing tribes that do not keep
slaves; in that case the foregoing argument would prove insufficient. Therefore we
shall apply here the <i lang="la">experimentum crucis</i>; we shall inquire how much the economic and social life of the slave-keeping tribes
differs from that of the other tribes. This investigation may be instructive in various
respects. It might be, that of the supposed causes of slavery some were found among
non-slave-keeping as well as among slave-keeping tribes, whereas others existed among
none but slave-keeping tribes; then the latter causes only would be decisive. Or perhaps
we shall find that each of these causes exists among one or more non-slave-keeping
tribes; but that the combination of all the causes is found nowhere but among slave-keeping
tribes. It were also possible, that a combination of the same causes existed among
non-slave-keeping tribes, but that among these there were other circumstances neutralizing
the former. Whether any of these possibilities is a reality, will appear from the
ensuing investigation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>We do not, however, think that it is necessary to give a survey of the economic and
social life of all non-slave-keeping hunters and fishers. For we have seen that among
the tribes of the Pacific Coast of North America the growth of slavery is much furthered
by their forming a somewhat homogeneous group. Accordingly slavery among the few slave-keeping
tribes outside the Pacific Coast seems to be little developed. Now there are many
non-slave-keeping hunting and fishing tribes, either living quite isolated (<i>e.g.</i> Andaman Islanders, Fuegians) or surrounded by more powerful, agricultural or pastoral,
tribes (<i>e.g.</i> Bushmen, African pigmies). That such a position is very unfavourable to the existence
of slavery is evident. We shall therefore confine ourselves to a survey of the three
great groups of hunters and fishers outside the Pacific Coast: the Australians, the
Indians of Central North America, and the Eskimos. Australia and the regions where
the Eskimos live are inhabited by hunters and fishers only. In Central North America
a few agricultural tribes of the lowest stage (hunting agriculturists) are found;
but these differ so little from hunters proper, that we may speak here of a group
of hunters, not inclosed between superior peoples. Perhaps the hunters and hunting
agriculturists of Brazil, Paraguay, etc. form a similar group; but the literature
on these tribes accessible to us was rather incomplete.
</p>
<p>We shall inquire now, whether the several circumstances furthering the growth of slavery
on the Pacific Coast, are found among each of these groups.
</p>
<p>In the first place we shall regard Australia.
</p>
<p>1º. <i>Abundance of food.</i> Food in Australia is by no means abundant and often very scarce. The Australians
are omnivorous in the widest sense of the word; they eat even mice, rats, lizards,
beetles, etc. In some parts of Australia, especially on the West Coast and in the
interior, the natives are continually suffering from hunger<a class="noteRef" id="n228.1src" href="#n228.1">181</a>. Thomas remarks: “In few parts of Australia can the native count on anything like
regular supplies of food. He is dependent on the course of the seasons for his seeds
and fruits; the time of year also affects the supply of fish in many parts; and in
Central Australia, perhaps owing <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>to the barrenness of the land, much time is given up, if our accounts are accurate,
to magical ceremonies, whose object is to promote the increase of game and plant life,
so difficult does the native find it to obtain sustenance”<a class="noteRef" id="n229.1src" href="#n229.1">182</a>. We shall soon see that scarcity of food compels them to live in very small groups.
</p>
<p>2º. <i>Variety of food.</i> There is a great variety. Concerning S.&nbsp;W. Australia Gerland enumerates 6 kinds of
kangaroos, 29 of fish, two of seals; and further wild dogs, emus and other birds,
tortoises, opossums, frogs, shell-fish, grubs of beetles, bird’s eggs, mice, rats,
snakes and lizards; roots, mushrooms, resins and various fruits<a class="noteRef" id="n229.2src" href="#n229.2">183</a>. But this list, including (as Gerland remarks) everything eatable, proves only that
they live very poorly. The natives of South Australia also, according to Eylmann,
though they have a great many kinds of food, seldom live in abundance. During the
frequent times of drought they suffer severely from want of food<a class="noteRef" id="n229.3src" href="#n229.3">184</a>. In Central Australia “with certain restrictions … everything which is edible is
used for food”<a class="noteRef" id="n229.4src" href="#n229.4">185</a>. And as for fishing, though fish enters for a large part into the subsistence of
the coast tribes, there are no fishing tribes in the higher sense in Australia, like
those of the Pacific Coast. Their canoes, where they have any, are very primitive;
and the principal means of catching fish are by spearing and setting traps<a class="noteRef" id="n229.5src" href="#n229.5">186</a>.
</p>
<p>3º. <i>Fixed habitations, large groups, preserving of food.</i> Gerland states that to find sufficient food, the Australians must continually roam
over the country. These wandering tribes cannot be large, else food would fail them;
so the division of the Australians into numerous small tribes is a consequence of
the nature of their country<a class="noteRef" id="n229.6src" href="#n229.6">187</a>. Spencer and Gillen speak of the natives of Central Australia as living in small
local groups<a class="noteRef" id="n229.7src" href="#n229.7">188</a>. Brough Smyth remarks: “It is necessary for a tribe to move very frequently from
place to place, always keeping within the boundaries of the country which it calls
its own—, now to the spot where eels can be taken in the creeks; often to the feeding-grounds
of the kangaroo; sometimes to the thicker forests to get wood suitable for making
weapons; to the sea-coast <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>continually for fish of various kinds; and, at the right season, to the lands where
are found the native bread, the yam, and the acacia gum”<a class="noteRef" id="n230.1src" href="#n230.1">189</a>. According to Eylmann, the natives of South Australia, in their barren country, are
forced not only to continually move on, but to live in small hordes<a class="noteRef" id="n230.2src" href="#n230.2">190</a>. And Thomas states that “the tribal areas are almost invariably small”<a class="noteRef" id="n230.3src" href="#n230.3">191</a>. The writers who describe separate tribes also often state that these tribes are
nomadic and live in small groups. We shall quote here only the statements of our ethnographers
concerning one significant fact, that presents a striking contrast to the state of
things on the Pacific Coast, viz. the improvidence of the Australians. In the Moore
River District of W. Australia food is abundant in the summer; but the natives are
reckless of the future; they consume whatever they have got. The natives of S.&nbsp;W.
Australia preserve no food; if the game killed is too much for a family to eat in
one day, neighbouring families are invited and a feast is given, till nothing is left.
They do, however, store up acacia gum, and carry roots with them. The Queenslanders
on Herbert River think only of the present moment. The Cammarray of N.&nbsp;S. Wales eat
as long as they have anything; they never lay up provisions, except when a dead whale
has been cast on shore. Of the aborigines of N.&nbsp;S. Wales in general Fraser tells us:
“When the fish are abundant, the fishers cannot use a tithe of the fish they catch,
and so sell them to all comers at a few pence for a backful. As for themselves, they
have a noble feast, they and all their tribe; and, as is their habit whenever they
have abundance, they gorge themselves so that their bodies are swollen to unnatural
dimensions and seem ready to burst. When they can hold no more, they go to sleep like
snakes, and sleep for twenty-four hours or more.” Similar particulars are gives by
Angas. Spencer and Gillen, in their description of the natives of Central Australia,
remark that “when times are favourable the black fellow is as lighthearted as possible.
He has not the slightest thought of, or care for, what the morrow may bring forth,
and lives entirely in the present”<a class="noteRef" id="n230.4src" href="#n230.4">192</a>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>As for the Tasmanians: “They lay up no store of provisions, and have been known in
winter time to eat kangaroo skins”<a class="noteRef" id="n231.1src" href="#n231.1">193</a>. Matthews, speaking of several tribes of Queensland and South Australia, states that
they “are very improvident, and accumulate no property beyond their weapons and rugs”<a class="noteRef" id="n231.2src" href="#n231.2">194</a>. And Forrest tells us that the natives of Central and Western Australia “live from
hand to mouth, never collect more than enough for the day, and each morning have to
look out for their day’s food”<a class="noteRef" id="n231.3src" href="#n231.3">195</a>. Thomas remarks, that it is not true that the Australian does not store food. “Much
of his food he must perforce eat quickly, or natural processes would make his labour
in vain. But the <i>bunya-bunya</i> nut, grass and other seed cakes, and possibly other kinds of food, were certainly
put aside for future use”<a class="noteRef" id="n231.4src" href="#n231.4">196</a>. He evidently means to say, that their preserving relatively little food is not due
to improvidence, but to necessity. But however this may be, the fact that most of
the collected food is consumed quickly remains, and this fact, not the underlying
motives, has important consequences with regard to the economic structure of their
society.

<p>4º. <i>Trade and industry.</i> Bartering is not at all unknown among the Australians. Fraser, speaking of N.&nbsp;S.
Wales, remarks: “I have already spoken of pipe-clay and ruddle as articles of trade;
the Mindi-mindi gatherings are the markets at which this trade is carried on. The
necessity for these fairs is not far to seek. A black man’s own “taurai” does not
furnish everything he requires for his daily life. In it there may be food enough,
but he wants suitable stone for an axe, wood for his spears, and “bumerangs” and shields
and clubs, flint for cutting and skinning, gum to be used as cement, and lumps of
gritty sandstone, on which to sharpen his stone-axe; for adornment, the pipe-clay
and the red-ochre are much valued, and so are swan-down feathers and the rose-coloured
crests of a certain kind of cockatoo; some of these he can <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>supply, and for them he gets in barter others that he wants. Then also there are manufactured
articles which he can give in exchange,—cloaks, rugs, baskets, knitted bags, nets,
weapons, and tools; most of these articles bear the “brand” of the maker. In this
way the black man’s wants are supplied by the mutual interchange of commodities. I
suppose that, at these fairs, the usual amount of haggling goes on in the making of
bargains, but there is no <span class="corr" id="xd32e14069" title="Source: quarrelling">quarreling</span>; for, during the time, universal brotherhood prevails. The fairs are held whenever
there is a need for them”<a class="noteRef" id="n232.1src" href="#n232.1">197</a>. Intertribal commerce is also carried on by the Narrinyeri and Dieri<a class="noteRef" id="n232.2src" href="#n232.2">198</a>. It seems, indeed, that there is hardly any savage tribe, among which the interchange
of commodities is quite unknown.<a class="noteRef" id="n232.3src" href="#n232.3">199</a> And in N.&nbsp;S. Wales it is not only the spontaneous products of nature that are exchanged,
but manufactured articles, so the trade requires industry. Yet trade and industry
are not nearly so fully developed here as on the Pacific Coast. Nowhere are there
particulars given, showing that any Australian tribe is, like the Koniagas of the
Pacific Coast, “adapted to labour and commerce rather than to war and hunting.” On
the Pacific Coast the coast tribes exchange their manufactured goods for the raw products
of the hinterland; but in Australia there is nothing but hinterland.
</p>
<p>That trade and industry do not signify nearly so much as on the Pacific Coast is clearly
proved by their not having here the same effect; they have not led in Australia to
any development of:
</p>
<p>5º. <i>Property and wealth.</i> Professor Steinmetz, in his <i lang="de">Entwicklung der Strafe</i>, has closely studied the forms of government existing among the Australian natives.
From the details he gives it appears, that a man’s influence depends on his age, his
bravery, eloquence, etc., and his having numerous relatives, but not on his wealth.
Among the Queenslanders described by Lumholtz the old men have most influence. Among
the Kurnai age, rather than bravery, gives influence. In Central Australia a man’s
power depends chiefly on his age, but also on force, courage, prudence, dexterity,
perseverance, and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>number of his relatives. On the Bourke and Darling rivers the council of old men is
the only form of government. In Tasmania a man’s influence depended on his strength,
courage, perseverance, prudence, and dexterity. The old men were highly honoured and
had many wives. In the Wellington tribe there is no government whatever; all are equal.
Among the Cammarray the old men are chiefs. Among the Narrinyeri chieftainship is
elective; wisdom, moderation, and good humour are the qualities most required in a
chief. Among the Dieri the oldest man of the clan is chief, but has not always most
power. A chief has real power only when, besides his age, he has other valued qualities,
such as bravery, eloquence, or a large family. Great warriors, orators and sorcerers
have most influence. In the Moore River District there is no government, a perfect
equality prevails. The natives of Port Lincoln have no government; old people are
held in high esteem. In the Western District of Victoria “the succession to the chiefdom
is by inheritance”. “The eldest son is appointed, unless there is some good reason
for setting him aside.” If the heir is weakly in body or mentally unfitted to maintain
the position of chief,— which requires to be filled by a man of ability and bravery,—
and has a better-qualified brother, he must give way to the latter or fight him in
single combat. Among the tribes of Victoria described by Le Souëf government in the
true sense does not exist, but the bravest and strongest, and often the most dangerous
men, have most influence<a class="noteRef" id="n233.1src" href="#n233.1">200</a>. Some other statements lead to the same conclusion. In N.&nbsp;W. Central Queensland “a
ripe old age constitutes the highest social status in the camp, and the one calling
for the greatest respect. There is no single individual chief to direct affairs”<a class="noteRef" id="n233.2src" href="#n233.2">201</a>. In N.&nbsp;S. Wales, according to Fraser, “there is nothing of the nature of kingly rule
in any one of the tribes, nor is there an over-chief for the whole of a tribe; but
the affairs of each section of a tribe are administered by a number of elders, among
whom one man is considered the leader or chief, because of his superior wisdom and
influence”. “If there are two rivals competing for the chiefship, they settle the
matter by single <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>combat”. And Wilkes says: “As no system of government exists, or any acknowledgment
of power to enact laws, they are solely guided by old usage”<a class="noteRef" id="n234.1src" href="#n234.1">202</a>. Among the Dieri chieftainship is elective according to the influence of the candidate’s
clan and his oratorical power<a class="noteRef" id="n234.2src" href="#n234.2">203</a>. About Powell’s Creek there is no government whatever; “the oldest man in the tribe
would usually carry most sway in tribal matters”<a class="noteRef" id="n234.3src" href="#n234.3">204</a>. Matthews, speaking of several tribes of Queensland and South Australia, remarks:
“They have elders or chiefs corresponding with the Indian Medicine men, who I believe
are principally self-constituted, or admitted as such on the score of age or personal
prowess. Great respect is attached to age as a rule, especially in visiting another
tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n234.4src" href="#n234.4">205</a>. Among the native tribes of Central Australia, described by Spencer and Gillen, the
chief has “a position which, if he be a man of personal ability, but only in that
case, enables him to wield considerable power”<a class="noteRef" id="n234.5src" href="#n234.5">206</a>. In South Australia the chiefs are either hereditary or elected for their personal
qualities<a class="noteRef" id="n234.6src" href="#n234.6">207</a>. A describer of the natives of North Australia tells us: “There are no recognized
chiefs in a tribe in the true sense of the word, as far as I have come in contact
with them; the old men of each tribe form themselves into a sort of council when anything
of importance is to be discussed, and what they decide upon is generally carried out”<a class="noteRef" id="n234.7src" href="#n234.7">208</a>. Thomas remarks that, among the Australians in general, “where there was a tendency
to select the son of the late headman, it was modified by the rule that he must have
shown himself worthy of the post by attaining distinction as a warrior, orator or
bard”<a class="noteRef" id="n234.8src" href="#n234.8">209</a>, and Brough Smyth has the following statement: “The government of aboriginal tribes
is not a democracy. There are the doctors or sorcerers who, under some circumstances,
have supreme power; there are the warriors who in time of trouble are absolute masters;
there are the dreamers, who direct and control the movements of the tribe until their
divinations are fulfilled or forgotten; there are the old men (councillors) <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>without whose advice even the warriors are slow to move; and, finally, there are the
old women, who noisily intimate their designs and endeavour by clamour and threats
to influence the leaders of their tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n235.1src" href="#n235.1">210</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that influence and power in Australia depend on personal qualities, not on
wealth. We have only found two instances on record of men trying to strengthen their
influence by means of their property. Gason tells us of a celebrated Dieri chief,
who received regular tributes from the hordes under his control. The writer often
observed him distributing presents among his personal friends, in order to avoid their
jealousy<a class="noteRef" id="n235.2src" href="#n235.2">211</a>. But this is quite another thing than what we found existing on the Pacific Coast
of North America. In the latter group a rich man, by being rich, attains to power;
whereas here the chief, elected for his personal qualities, receives tributes, and
by distributing what he has received strengthens his influence. Moreover we are told
that these Dieri “have no property except a few weapons or ornaments; they are generally
buried or destroyed”, viz. after their owner’s death<a class="noteRef" id="n235.3src" href="#n235.3">212</a>. Lumholtz speaks of an old man in Queensland who distributed his property among his
fellow-tribesmen to attain to greater influence<a class="noteRef" id="n235.4src" href="#n235.4">213</a>. This looks somewhat like the state of things existing on the Pacific Coast; but
as the same writer tells us that there is no government except the council of old
men, this may be an isolated case. And even if among one or two tribes wealth gave
a certain influence, this would not impair the conclusion we have arrived at, that
generally a man’s influence and power do not depend upon his wealth, whence we may
infer that wealth and property are little developed here.
</p>
<p>6º. <i>Condition of women.</i> Whereas on the Pacific Coast women are held in rather high esteem, and therefore
provided by the men with slaves who help them in their work, the condition of women
in Australia is decidedly bad, as we have seen in the first chapter of Part I<a class="noteRef" id="n235.5src" href="#n235.5">214</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>7º. <i>Militarism.</i> We have shown that slaves are sometimes taken in order to strengthen their masters’
force in warfare. On the other hand, where militarism does not prevail to any considerable
extent, the tribe can afford the luxury of having male slaves living among them who
do not fight. As for the Australians, their wars generally are not sanguinary, and
often settled by single combat<a class="noteRef" id="n236.1src" href="#n236.1">215</a>.
</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the Australians differ from the tribes of the Pacific Coast
of North America in many respects. Food is by no means abundant; the highly developed
fishing methods of the Pacific Coast are unknown here; the Australians are migratory
and improvident, and live in small groups; though some tribes interchange commodities,
trade and industry do not signify nearly so much as on the Pacific Coast; the objects
of property are very few and wealth does not exist; the condition of women is a bad
one. Only in two respects do both groups agree: there is a great variety of food,
and militarism does not prevail to any great extent. We have seen, however, that “variety
of food” here means that the Australians must avail themselves of whatever is eatable,
<i>i.e.</i> that they live in the deepest misery. Therefore henceforth we shall no longer speak
of variety of food as a circumstance favourable to the existence of slavery; and in
the next paragraphs we shall not inquire whether the Central North Americans and Eskimos
have a variety of food.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This paragraph will contain a survey of the economic state of the group of hunting
tribes, extending across North America, from the Montagnais near the Atlantic Coast
to the Apaches of Texas. Besides hunters in the proper sense this group includes the
Cheyennes and Comanches, who, though slight traces of agriculture were found among
them, subsisted almost entirely on the products of the chase.
</p>
<p>1º <i>Abundance of food.</i> Le Jeune, speaking of the Montagnais, <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>says: “The savages are almost always hungry”<a class="noteRef" id="n237.1src" href="#n237.1">216</a>. The Chepewyans “are not remarkable for their activity as hunters, owing to the ease
with which they snare deer and spear fish”<a class="noteRef" id="n237.2src" href="#n237.2">217</a>. Among the Kutchins a good hunter can always, except in very unfavourable circumstances,
procure sufficient food<a class="noteRef" id="n237.3src" href="#n237.3">218</a>. The Beaver Indians, according to Mackenzie, seemed to live in a state of comparative
comfort<a class="noteRef" id="n237.4src" href="#n237.4">219</a>. The Comanches in the summer, when the buffaloes remove to the North, often suffer
from want of food<a class="noteRef" id="n237.5src" href="#n237.5">220</a>. Lewis and Clark tell us, that the Shoshones “suffer the extremes of want; for two-thirds
of the year they are forced to live in the mountains, passing whole weeks without
meat, and with nothing to eat but a few fish and roots”<a class="noteRef" id="n237.6src" href="#n237.6">221</a>. Grinnell, speaking of the inland Indians in general, remarks: “The life of the Indian
was in some respects a hard one, for the question of food was an ever-present anxiety
with him”<a class="noteRef" id="n237.7src" href="#n237.7">222</a>.
</p>
<p>Considering the foregoing statements, and remembering Tanner’s narrative that gives
a description of a continual struggle for mere existence, we may safely conclude that,
though a few of these tribes lived rather comfortably, food, among the Indians of
Central North America in general, was not nearly so abundant as on the Pacific Coast.
</p>
<p>2º. Whereas the tribes of the Pacific Coast subsist chiefly by <i>fishing</i>, the Indians of Central North America are, nearly all of them, hunters (See § 2 of
this chapter).
</p>
<p>3º. <i>Fixed habitations, large groups, preserving of food.</i> In a general description of the “vast but thinly populated interior of Northern America”
we read that, with regard to the mode of living, a distinction is to be made between
the thick-wood Indians and the prairie Indians. The thick-wood Indians consist of
small groups. During the summer they live on waterfowl, fish, berries, etc. In the
winter they often suffer from want of food. The prairie Indians during the whole year
live on the buffalo. Their groups number on an average 400 people<a class="noteRef" id="n237.8src" href="#n237.8">223</a>. The Montagnais, in Le Jeune’s time, were wandering and few in number; their life
consisted of feasting as long <span class="corr" id="xd32e14235" title="Source: es">as</span> they had <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>anything; they lived from hand to mouth and did not lay up any provision<a class="noteRef" id="n238.1src" href="#n238.1">224</a>. The same writer calls the Algonquins a wandering tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n238.2src" href="#n238.2">225</a>. The Ojibways, according to Keating, are divided into small groups, each containing
a few families. They do not lay up any provision for winter use. Jones also remarks,
that they are very improvident. Kohl, however, gives a long description of the fruits
preserved by them<span id="xd32e14247"></span><a class="noteRef" id="n238.3src" href="#n238.3">226</a>. The Knisteneaux often, at one feast, consume what would have been enough for several
weeks<a class="noteRef" id="n238.4src" href="#n238.4">227</a>. The Blackfeet tribes are nomadic in their habits<a class="noteRef" id="n238.5src" href="#n238.5">228</a>. Ross tells us, that the Eastern Tinneh “are obliged to lead a wandering life, in
order to procure food either by fishing or hunting”<a class="noteRef" id="n238.6src" href="#n238.6">229</a>. The Indians on the Upper Yukon are very improvident. When fish is abundant, they
gorge themselves with it, instead of drying it for winter use<a class="noteRef" id="n238.7src" href="#n238.7">230</a>. The Kutchins live in transportable dwellings. According to Kirby they “are divided
into many petty tribes”. Hardisty, however, states that they generally live in large
groups<a class="noteRef" id="n238.8src" href="#n238.8">231</a>. Mackenzie speaks of a Beaver Indian establishment of about 300 inhabitants<a class="noteRef" id="n238.9src" href="#n238.9">232</a>. The Sioux live in small bands, owing to the scarcity of game<a class="noteRef" id="n238.10src" href="#n238.10">233</a>. The Osages are nomadic. Our informant speaks of an Osage town of 1500 inhabitants<a class="noteRef" id="n238.11src" href="#n238.11">234</a>. Apache tribes of 100–200 people, of whom 25–50 are warriors, are headed by a captain.
They are “nomadic and roving in their habits”. “Seldom do they remain more than a
week in one locality”<a class="noteRef" id="n238.12src" href="#n238.12">235</a>. The Comanches “usually roam in small subdivisions, varying according to caprice
or the scarcity or abundance of game”. These subdivisions consist of 20–110 families.
Brancroft remarks about the Comanches: “No provision is made for a time of scarcity,
but when many buffalo are killed, they cut portions of them into long strips, which,
after being dried in the sun, are pounded fine. This pemican they carry with them
in their hunting expeditions, and when unsuccessful in the chase, a small quantity
boiled in water or cooked with grease, serves for a <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>meal”<a class="noteRef" id="n239.1src" href="#n239.1">236</a>. These details do not quite agree with Bancroft’s assertion that “no provision is
made”. Grinnell remarks, that the Indians are often undeservedly taxed with improvidence.
“We are told in books much about the Indian’s improvidence, and it is frequently stated
that however abundant food might be with him to-day, he took no thought for the needs
of the morrow. Such statements are untrue and show but superficial observation. The
savage does not look so far ahead as does the civilized man, but still the lessons
of experience are not wholly lost on him. He remembers past hardships, and endeavours
to provide against their recurrence; and these people were rather remarkable for their
foresight, and for the provision which they were accustomed to make for the future”<a class="noteRef" id="n239.2src" href="#n239.2">237</a>.
</p>
<p>However this may be, it is evident that the supplies these wandering tribes (as they
subsist on hunting, we may safely suppose that they are all of them nomadic, whether
this be explicitly stated or not) were able to store for winter’s use, cannot compare
with those of the tribes of the Pacific Coast.
</p>
<p>4º. <i>Trade and industry.</i> The Montagnais, in Le Jeune’s time, bought maize from the Hurons for elk-skins<a class="noteRef" id="n239.3src" href="#n239.3">238</a>. The Algonquins, according to the same writer, used to sell furs to the French<a class="noteRef" id="n239.4src" href="#n239.4">239</a>. The Blackfeet tribes sold peltries which they procured in the Northern part of their
country<a class="noteRef" id="n239.5src" href="#n239.5">240</a>. Jones calls the Kutcha Kutchin traders: “they make very little for themselves, but
buy from the other Indians.” And Hardisty tells us, that they live by trading; they
exchange beads, which are their circulating medium, for the peltries of other tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n239.6src" href="#n239.6">241</a>. The Osages, too, carried on the fur-trade in Hunter’s time<a class="noteRef" id="n239.7src" href="#n239.7">242</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that trade does not hold a large place in the economic life of these Indians,
and that only raw products are exchanged.
</p>
<p>Grinnell enumerates the branches of industry existing among them. “Food supply and
defence against enemies depended on the warrior’s weapons. These were his most precious
possessions, and he gave much care to their manufacture. Knowing nothing of metals,
he made his edge tools of sharpened stones.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>“The most important part of the warrior’s equipment was the bow, and over no part
of it was more time and labour spent.” “The stone axe, the maul, and the lance were
all simple weapons.” “A very important part of the warrior’s outfit was the shield,
with which he stopped or turned aside the arrows of his enemy. It was usually circular
in shape, and was made of the thick, shrunken hide of a buffalo bull’s neck.” “Clothing
was made of skins tanned with or without the fur.” “Many tribes—especially those to
the south—made a simple pottery.… Among the northern tribes, where pottery was least
known, ladles, spoons, bows, and dishes were usually formed from horn or wood”. “The
different tribes had but slight knowledge of the textile art, and this knowledge seems
to have been greatest in the south and on the coast.” “Three vehicles were known to
the primitive Indian—the travois in the south and the sledge in the north for land
travel, and the canoe wherever there were water ways.” “The Indian’s ideas of art
are rude.” “It is in the art of carving, however, that the greatest skill was shown”<a class="noteRef" id="n240.1src" href="#n240.1">243</a>. So these tribes do not seem to have attained to a high industrial development; the
less, as most of the instances Grinnell gives of their skill in carving relate to
tribes of the Pacific Coast.
</p>
<p>5º. <i>Property and wealth.</i> Whereas on the Pacific Coast influence and power depend on wealth, we shall see that
in Central North America it is otherwise. Le Jeune, speaking of the Montagnais, remarks:
“Rhetoric controls all these tribes, as the captain is elected for his eloquence alone,
and is obeyed in proportion to his use of it, for they have no other law than his
word”<a class="noteRef" id="n240.2src" href="#n240.2">244</a>. Roosevelt states that among the Algonquins the war-chief “wielded only the influence
that he could secure by his personal prowess and his tact”<a class="noteRef" id="n240.3src" href="#n240.3">245</a>. The power of an Ojibway chief depended upon his wisdom, courage, and hospitality<a class="noteRef" id="n240.4src" href="#n240.4">246</a>. Of the Blackfeet we are told: “Chiefs never receive a gift, considering it a degradation
to accept anything but what their own prowess or superior qualities of manhood acquire
for them. Their hearts are so good and strong that they scorn to take <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>anything, and self-denial and the power to resist temptation to luxury or easily acquired
property is a boast with them. On these men, in time of peace, when difficulties occur
among themselves, the tribe relies, and in time of war they are their leaders to the
scene of action”. And Schoolcraft states that the chiefs “have little or no power,
unless they have distinguished themselves as warriors and are supported by a band
of braves”<a class="noteRef" id="n241.1src" href="#n241.1">247</a>. Among the Kutchins, according to Jones, the chiefs are elected for their wisdom
and courage. Hardisty, however, states that the power of the chiefs depends on the
number of beads they own; for these afford a means of injuring those who displease
them. And Whymper remarks: “The chiefs, who are without exception good hunters or
fishers, often procure or strengthen their position by periodical distributions of
their chattels. They not seldom have the worst clothing and food of all inhabitants”<a class="noteRef" id="n241.2src" href="#n241.2">248</a>. Among the Cheyennes generally the bravest and wisest man is elected as a chief<a class="noteRef" id="n241.3src" href="#n241.3">249</a>. Mrs. Eastman tells us of the Sioux, that formerly “their bravest men, their war
chief too, no doubt exercized a control over the rest.” The chief lived like the common
people and Neill remarks: “The individual who desires to improve his condition is
not only laughed at, but maltreated. Moreover, if he acquires any property, there
is no law which secures it to him, and it is liable to be taken away at any time by
any ill-disposed person”<a class="noteRef" id="n241.4src" href="#n241.4">250</a>. Among the Apaches, according to Schoolcraft, “the chiefs are the wealthiest men,
the most warlike, the first in battle, the wisest in council”. According to Ten Kate
the power of the chiefs depends on their success in forays. And Bancroft remarks:
“Sometimes it happens that one family retains the chieftaincy in a tribe during several
generations, because of the bravery or wealth of the sons”<a class="noteRef" id="n241.5src" href="#n241.5">251</a>. Comanche chiefs, according to Schoolcraft, “are selected for their known or pretended
prowess in war”. In another place he states, that they <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>are made chiefs for their “superior cunning, knowledge or success in war”<a class="noteRef" id="n242.1src" href="#n242.1">252</a>.
</p>
<p>Influence and power depend thus on bravery, wisdom, eloquence, not on wealth. Only
among the Apaches does it depend on wealth, though not on wealth exclusively. The
distributions of property among the Kutchins somewhat resemble those on the Pacific
Coast, but are not indicative of quite the same development of wealth; for on the
Pacific Coast wealth consists to a large extent of more durable goods, such as houses,
canoes, etc.
</p>
<p>A few other statements also tend to prove, that wealth is not highly developed; the
economic life of some tribes shows rather communistic features. Among the Kutchins,
“unless he is alone, a hunter cannot take and appropriate the meat of the animal he
kills. Should he do so, he would be considered mean. And this feeling is strong. When
two good hunters go together, good and well, the one has as good a chance of getting
meat as the other; but when one is a bad hunter and the other a good one, the former
gets all the meat and the real hunter has nothing, and loses his ammunition into the
bargain”<a class="noteRef" id="n242.2src" href="#n242.2">253</a>. Among the Chepewyans the game is distributed among those who shared in the chase.
The game which a man catches in his share is his private property; “nevertheless any
unsuccessful hunter passing by may take a deer so caught, leaving the head, skin,
and saddle for the owner”<a class="noteRef" id="n242.3src" href="#n242.3">254</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Osages, too, wealth was formerly unknown; for in Hunter’s time the old men
disapproved of the fur-trade, which gave abundance and thereby led to effeminacy<a class="noteRef" id="n242.4src" href="#n242.4">255</a>.
</p>
<p>6º. <i>Condition of women.</i> Le Jeune states, that among the Montagnais the sex has great influence. Household
affairs are left to the discretion of the women, without any male interference. The
women “cut and decide and give away as they please”<a class="noteRef" id="n242.5src" href="#n242.5">256</a>. Ojibway women, according to Jones, do the hardest work, are slaves of the men, get
the worst food and the worst place in the wigwam; and Long states, that the wives
are the slaves of their husbands. According to Kohl, nearly all <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>kinds of work, except the chase, fell to the share of the women, who were even obliged
to bring home the bears killed by the men<a class="noteRef" id="n243.1src" href="#n243.1">257</a>. Mackenzie tells us, that among the Knisteneaux women are in the same subjected condition
as among other wild tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n243.2src" href="#n243.2">258</a>. Among the Blackfeet the husband may send his wife away when he likes; she then takes
her property with her; the children remain with the father. Many men have 6 or 8 wives;
they readily lend them to whites for brandy<a class="noteRef" id="n243.3src" href="#n243.3">259</a>. Chepewyan wives are subjected to their husbands, who are very jealous and “for very
trifling causes treat them with such cruelty as sometimes to occasion their death”<a class="noteRef" id="n243.4src" href="#n243.4">260</a>. Among the Kutchins, as we have seen in § 2, the condition of women is a rather bad
one<a class="noteRef" id="n243.5src" href="#n243.5">261</a>. Mackenzie speaks of the “extreme subjection and abasement” of Beaver Indian women<a class="noteRef" id="n243.6src" href="#n243.6">262</a>. Cheyenne women perform all the drudgery. Yet they have some influence in government
matters; they do not attend the councils; but their wishes, privately uttered, are
not generally disregarded<a class="noteRef" id="n243.7src" href="#n243.7">263</a>. Among the Sioux women as children and wives are despised, as girls a little more
honoured. And Schoolcraft states that they exercise some influence in tribal matters
by expressing their desires at home, but are not admitted to the council<a class="noteRef" id="n243.8src" href="#n243.8">264</a>. Bancroft, speaking of the Apache family in general (including Apaches, Comanches,
and several other tribes), remarks: “Womankind as usual is at a discount. The female
child receives little care from its mother, being only of collateral advantage to
the tribe. Later she becomes the beast of burden and slave of her husband.” But another
statement of the same writer proves that the women’s condition is not so very bad:
“The marriage yoke sits lightly; the husband may repudiate his wife and take back
the property given for her; the wife may abandon her husband, but by the latter act
she covers him with such disgrace that it may only be wiped out by killing somebody—anybody
whom he may chance to meet”<a class="noteRef" id="n243.9src" href="#n243.9">265</a>. The wife may thus with impunity leave her husband, the latter venting his anger
upon “somebody”. <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>Schoolcraft states that Comanche women are not thought much of, even by themselves;
the husband has unlimited sway over his wife<a class="noteRef" id="n244.1src" href="#n244.1">266</a>. Among the Shoshones, according to Lewis and Clark, “the man is the sole proprietor
of his wives and daughters, and can barter them away, or dispose of them in any manner
he may think proper.” “The mass of the females are condemned, as among all savage
nations, to the lowest and most laborious drudgery”<a class="noteRef" id="n244.2src" href="#n244.2">267</a>.
</p>
<p>Now let us inquire what Grinnell, who is so well acquainted with Indian life, has
to say about the treatment of women among the Indians in general. “A word or two with
regard to the position of the wife in the household may not be out of place here.
The Indian woman, it is usually thought, is a mere drudge and slave, but, so far as
my observations extend, this notion is wholly an erroneous one. It is true that the
women were the labourers of the camp, that they did all the hard work about which
there was no excitement. They cooked, brought wood and water, dried the meat, dressed
the robes, made the clothing, collected the lodge poles, packed the horses, cultivated
the ground, and generally performed all the tasks which might be called menial, but
they were not mere servants. On the contrary, their position was very respectable.
They were consulted on many subjects, not only in connection with family affairs,
but in more important and general matters. Sometimes women were even admitted to the
councils and spoke there, giving their advice. This privilege was very unusual, and
was granted only to women who had performed some deed which was worthy of a man. This
in practice meant that she had killed or counted <i>coup</i> on an enemy, or had been to war. In ordinary family conversation women did not hesitate
to interrupt and correct their husbands when the latter made statements with which
they did not agree, and the men listened to them with respectful attention, though
of course this depended on the standing of the woman, her intelligence, etc. While
their lives were hard and full of toil, they yet found time to get together for gossip
and for gambling, and on the whole managed to take a good deal of pleasure in <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>life”<a class="noteRef" id="n245.1src" href="#n245.1">268</a>. And Ten Kate, a careful observer, remarks that the Indians do not, as has often
been asserted, regard woman as a beast of burden and a drudge. Her condition, as compared
with that of the women of the lower classes in civilized countries, is rather better
than worse<a class="noteRef" id="n245.2src" href="#n245.2">269</a>.
</p>
<p>So the lot of the Indian woman is not so hard as at first sight it seems. Yet the
fact, that several ethnographers picture it in such dark colours, whereas the describers
of the tribes of the Pacific Coast agree, that the sex command great respect, tends
to prove, that the condition of women is not quite so good here as on the Pacific
Coast.
</p>
<p>7º. <i>Militarism.</i> These tribes are very warlike. Roosevelt states that warfare and hunting were the
chief occupations of the Algonquins<a class="noteRef" id="n245.3src" href="#n245.3">270</a>. Among the Ojibways the end of education is to make good hunters and warriors<a class="noteRef" id="n245.4src" href="#n245.4">271</a>. According to Mackenzie, warfare and hunting, among the Knisteneaux, are the occupations
of the men. They are continually engaged in warfare<a class="noteRef" id="n245.5src" href="#n245.5">272</a>. The Blackfeet were very warlike, and always fighting with their neighbours<a class="noteRef" id="n245.6src" href="#n245.6">273</a>. Mackenzie tells us, that it was a custom with Chepewyan chiefs “to go to war after
they had shed tears in order to wipe away the disgrace attached to such a feminine
weakness”<a class="noteRef" id="n245.7src" href="#n245.7">274</a>. The Beaver Indians were even more warlike than the Chepewyans<a class="noteRef" id="n245.8src" href="#n245.8">275</a>. Mrs. Eastman calls the Sioux “brave, daring, revengeful”<a class="noteRef" id="n245.9src" href="#n245.9">276</a>. The Apaches, according to Bancroft, “are in their industries extremely active,—their
industries being theft and murder, to which they are trained by their mothers, and
in which they display consummate cunning, treachery, and cruelty”<a class="noteRef" id="n245.10src" href="#n245.10">277</a>. And the same writer tells us that “the Comanches, who are better warriors than the
Apaches, highly honour bravery on the battle-field. From early youth, they are taught
the art of war, and the skilful handling of their horses and weapons; and they are
not allowed a seat in the council, until their name is garnished by some heroic deed”<a class="noteRef" id="n245.11src" href="#n245.11">278</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p>We see that the Indians of Central North America present a strongly marked contrast
with such tribes as the Koniagas who are “adapted to labour and commerce rather than
to war and hunting” and the Chinooks who “were always a commercial rather than a warlike
people”. Therefore all available men are wanted in warfare; they cannot afford to
have male slaves living among them, who do not share in their military operations.
They are very much in need of warriors, and little of labourers. Accordingly among
many of these tribes such prisoners of war as are allowed to live, are adopted into
the tribe or into some family within the tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n246.1src" href="#n246.1">279</a>.
</p>
<p>Concluding, we may remark, that the Indians of Central North America differ from the
tribes of the Pacific Coast in many respects. They have no abundance of food, are
hunters and nomadic; wealth does not exist, and militarism prevails to a great extent.
The groups in which they live, though larger than in Australia, are smaller than on
the Pacific Coast. Food is preserved, but not so systematically as on the Pacific
Coast. The condition of women, though not so bad as in Australia, is not quite so
good as among the slave-keeping tribes of the North-West Coast of North America. Their
trade consists only in exchanging raw products; and industry is little developed.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1º. <i>Abundance of food.</i> In Greenland vegetable food is very scarce. The flesh of the reindeer is most valued
by the Greenlanders, but is not available in large quantities; so they have to live
chiefly upon sea-animals, seals, fish and sea-birds<a class="noteRef" id="n246.2src" href="#n246.2">280</a>. Boas states that “the mode of life of all the Eskimo tribes of North-Eastern America
is very uniform.” They depend entirely on animal food, especially seals and deer<a class="noteRef" id="n246.3src" href="#n246.3">281</a>. Bancroft, speaking <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>of the Eskimos of Alaska, remarks: “Their substantials comprise the flesh of land
and marine animals, fish and birds; venison, and whale and seal blubber being chief”<a class="noteRef" id="n247.1src" href="#n247.1">282</a>. Though we nowhere find it stated that food is exceedingly scarce, the details given
here sufficiently prove that it is not nearly so abundant as on the Pacific Coast.
Shell-fish, fruits, roots, and other vegetables, acquired so easily and in large quantities
by the tribes of the Pacific Coast, do not enter for any considerable part into the
food of the Eskimos.
</p>
<p>2º. As for <i>fishing</i>, taken in the wider sense (including the killing of water animals besides fish),
all Eskimos are fishers.
</p>
<p>3º. <i>Fixed habitations, large groups, preserving of food.</i> Though the Eskimos move about much for the purpose of obtaining food, they are not
quite nomadic. In winter-time they live in solidly constructed dwellings<a class="noteRef" id="n247.2src" href="#n247.2">283</a>. Rink states that they have their winter-houses on the same place during several
generations<a class="noteRef" id="n247.3src" href="#n247.3">284</a>. Boas remarks: “There is no need of any new buildings, as the Eskimo always locate
in the old settlements and the old buildings are quite sufficient to satisfy all their
wants”<a class="noteRef" id="n247.4src" href="#n247.4">285</a>. And Crantz tells us that a Greenlander is not generally much inclined to leave the
place where he was born and bred and settle somewhere else; for in nearly every place
there is a peculiar method of fishing and seal-hunting, which the newcomer has to
learn; and in the meantime, often for several years, he is poorly off<a class="noteRef" id="n247.5src" href="#n247.5">286</a>. An Eskimo village most often consists of a single house<a class="noteRef" id="n247.6src" href="#n247.6">287</a>, but Eskimo houses accommodate several (in Greenland from 4 to 10) families<a class="noteRef" id="n247.7src" href="#n247.7">288</a>. Among the Western Eskimos, however, there are larger villages<a class="noteRef" id="n247.8src" href="#n247.8">289</a>. Food is preserved for winter use by the Eskimos, though not in such large quantities
as on the Pacific Coast. “The Esquimaux” says a writer on British North America “possess
a quality which I may say is almost unknown among Indians, namely, providence; thus,
in the season, when the animals are plentiful on the shores of the Arctic Sea, they
make “caches” of large quantities of meat for winter use”<a class="noteRef" id="n247.9src" href="#n247.9">290</a>. The Greenlanders, though laying up some provision for the winter, are rather improvident.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>As long as they have abundance of food, they feast and gorge themselves with it; but
in the winter they often live in the greatest misery<a class="noteRef" id="n248.1src" href="#n248.1">291</a>. Boas, speaking of Central Eskimo store-houses, remarks: “In winter, blubber and
meat are put away upon these pillars, which are sufficiently high to keep them from
the dogs.” Yet “the house presents a sad and gloomy appearance if stormy weather prevents
the men from hunting. The stores are quickly consumed, one lamp after another is extinguished,
and everybody sits motionless in the dark hut”<a class="noteRef" id="n248.2src" href="#n248.2">292</a>. Among the Eskimos of Alaska “meats are kept in seal-skin bags for over a year.…
Their winter store of oil they secure in seal-skin bags, which are buried in the frozen
ground”<a class="noteRef" id="n248.3src" href="#n248.3">293</a>.
</p>
<p>4º. <i>Trade and industry.</i> Rink states that the Eskimos make long journeys for the purpose of interchanging
such commodities, as are found in some districts only and yet are necessary to all
the tribes. The trade is carried on from Asia to Hudson Bay<a class="noteRef" id="n248.4src" href="#n248.4">294</a>. The Greenlanders mutually exchange the articles they need. With some of them bartering
is quite a passion; they often exchange useful things for worthless trifles. They
have a kind of annual fair, at which the inhabitants of several districts interchange
the products of their country. “A great article of commerce are vessels made of soapstone,
which are not found in all parts of the country; and, as the Southern Greenlanders
have no whales and the Northern no wood, there come, all through the summer months,
from the South and even from the East of the country many boats with Greenlanders
from 100 to 200 miles, to Disko, bringing new kyaks and women’s boats with the necessary
implements. They receive in exchange horns, teeth, bones, whale-bones and whale-tendons,
part of which, on their homeward voyage, they sell again”<a class="noteRef" id="n248.5src" href="#n248.5">295</a>. Among the Central Eskimos “two desiderata formed the principal inducement to long
journeys, which sometimes lasted even several years: wood and soapstone. The shores
of Davis’ Strait and Cumberland Sound are almost destitute of driftwood, and consequently
the natives were obliged to visit distant regions to obtain that necessary material.
Tudjaqdjuaq <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>in particular was the objective point of their expeditions. Their boats took a southerly
course, and, as the wood was gathered, a portion of it was immediately manufactured
into boat ribs and sledge runners, which were carried back on the return journey;
another portion was used for bows, though these were also made of deer’s horns ingeniously
lashed together. A portion of the trade in wood seems to have been in the hands of
the Nugumiut, who collected it on Tudjaqdjuaq and took it north. Another necessary
and important article of trade, soapstone, is manufactured into lamps and pots. It
is found in a few places only, and very rarely in pieces large enough for the manufacture
of the articles named.… The visitors come from every part of the country, the soapstone
being dug or “traded” from the rocks by depositing some trifles in exchange. In addition
to wood and soapstone, metals, which were extremely rare in old times, have formed
an important object of trade. They were brought to Baffin Bay either by the Aivillirmiut,
who had obtained them <span class="corr" id="xd32e14570" title="Source: fom">from</span> the Hudson Bay Company and the Kinipetu, or by the Akuliarmiut. Even when Frobisher
visited the Nugumiut in 1577 he found them in possession of some iron. The occurrence
of flint, which was the material for arrow-heads, may have given some importance to
places where it occurs. Formerly an important trade existed between the Netchillirmiut
and the neighbouring tribes. As the district of the former is destitute of driftwood
and potstone, they are compelled to buy both articles from their neighbours. In Ross’s
time they got the necessary wood from Ugjulik, the potstone from Aivillik. They exchanged
these articles for native iron (or pyrite), which they found on the eastern shore
of Boothia and which was used for striking fire. After having collected a sufficient
stock of it during several years, they travelled to the neighbouring tribes”<a class="noteRef" id="n249.1src" href="#n249.1">296</a>. The Eskimos of Alaska are also very commercial. “On the shore of Bering Strait the
natives have constant commercial intercourse with Asia.… They frequently meet at the
Gwosdeff Islands, where the Tschuktschi bring tobacco, iron, tame-reindeer skins,
and walrus-ivory; the Eskimos giving in exchange wolf and wolverine <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>skins, wooden dishes, seal-skins and other peltries. The Eskimos of the American coast
carry on quite an extensive trade with the Indians of the interior, exchanging with
them Asiatic merchandise for peltries”<a class="noteRef" id="n250.1src" href="#n250.1">297</a>. We see that most of the Eskimo trade is bartering of raw products. This agrees with
what Rink remarks, viz. that there is no division of labour; each group that has a
tent or boat is entirely self-dependent<a class="noteRef" id="n250.2src" href="#n250.2">298</a>.
</p>
<p>In industry they display much skill. Their boats are ingeniously made and have excited
the admiration of all travellers. “The kajak (qajaq) is almost exclusively used for
hunting by all Eskimo tribes from Greenland to Alaska”<a class="noteRef" id="n250.3src" href="#n250.3">299</a>. Crantz tells us that the implements the Greenlanders use for procuring their subsistence
are simple, but so well adapted to their purpose that they are more convenient than
the costly implements of the Europeans. Their harpoons consist of several pieces,
but are so ingeniously made that not a single piece is superfluous. Their boats are
also greatly admired by this writer<a class="noteRef" id="n250.4src" href="#n250.4">300</a>. And Bancroft tells us that “the Hyperboreans surpass all American nations in their
facilities for locomotion, both upon land and water. In their skin boats, the natives
of the Alaskan seaboard, from Point Barrow to Mount St. Elias, made long voyages,
crossing the strait and sea of Bering, and held commercial intercourse with the people
of Asia. Sixty miles is an ordinary day’s journey for sledges, while Indians on snow-shoes
have been known to run down and capture deer”. “So highly were these boats esteemed
by the Russians, that they were at once universally adopted by them in navigating
these waters. They were unable to invent any improvement in either of them”<a class="noteRef" id="n250.5src" href="#n250.5">301</a>.
</p>
<p>5º. <i>Property and wealth.</i> It is nowhere stated that a man’s rank or power depends upon his wealth. The Greenlanders
live without any government; the head of each family is independent. When several
families live together in one house, they have no control over each other, but voluntarily
obey the most respected head of a family, <i>i.e.</i> the one who is best acquainted with hunting and the signs of the weather. Yet our
<span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>informant also states: “If several Greenlanders live together, they like to keep an
<i>angekok</i> (priest), to avail themselves of his advice. And if they do not keep one, they are
despised or pitied by the others as being poor men”<a class="noteRef" id="n251.1src" href="#n251.1">302</a>. So poor people are despised, but this applies to villages or settlements rather
than individuals. This agrees with what Rink tells us of their communistic <i>régime</i>. Only the indispensable implements and utensils are individual property, and also
provisions sufficient for less than a year. If an individual or group have got too
much, they are compelled by public opinion to give it to those who have too little<a class="noteRef" id="n251.2src" href="#n251.2">303</a>. Among the Central Eskimos men unable to provide for themselves are employed as servants,
but their position “is a voluntary one, and therefore these men are not less esteemed
than the self-dependent providers”<a class="noteRef" id="n251.3src" href="#n251.3">304</a>. Among the Eskimos of Alaska “now or then some ancient or able man gains an ascendency
in the tribe, and overawes his fellows.” “Caste has been mentioned in connection with
tattooing, but, as a rule, social distinctions do not exist”<a class="noteRef" id="n251.4src" href="#n251.4">305</a>.
</p>
<p>Though the Eskimos are dependent for their subsistence on the possession of boats,
houses and implements, they do not want more property than is needed for procuring
their daily food. According to Rink, the benefit of an inheritance is smaller than
the duties it involves; for boat and tent continually require so much mending, that
a single hunter is hardly able to keep them in order<a class="noteRef" id="n251.5src" href="#n251.5">306</a>. In Greenland, if a man dies leaving no full-grown son, his goods devolve upon the
next of kin, who is obliged to provide for the widow and her children. But if he already
possesses a tent and a boat, he will leave the inheritance and the duties connected
with it to an alien; for nobody is capable of keeping two tents and two boats in repair<a class="noteRef" id="n251.6src" href="#n251.6">307</a>.
</p>
<p>6º. <i>Condition of women.</i> Though not quite so bad as in Australia, woman’s condition is not so good here as
among the Indians of the Pacific Coast. Greenland women lead a hard and almost slave-like
life, says Crantz<a class="noteRef" id="n251.7src" href="#n251.7">308</a>. And Bancroft tells us that among the Eskimos of Alaska “the lot of the women is
but little better than slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n251.8src" href="#n251.8">309</a>. The principal cause of this <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>difference perhaps is, that female labour among the Eskimos is not productive. In
Greenland “a man who has two wives is not despised; on the contrary he is looked upon
as an able provider”<a class="noteRef" id="n252.1src" href="#n252.1">310</a>. This proves that subsistence depends upon male, not as in Australia upon female
labour. Among the Central Eskimos “the principal part of the man’s work is to provide
for his family.… The woman has to do the household work, the sewing, and the cooking”<a class="noteRef" id="n252.2src" href="#n252.2">311</a>. Among the Western Eskimos “polygamy is common, every man being entitled to as many
wives, as he can get and maintain”<a class="noteRef" id="n252.3src" href="#n252.3">312</a>. So the man maintains the family; female labour, however useful, is not so indispensable
as male. The men know this quite well. In Greenland “the man hunts and fishes, and
having brought the animals ashore he pays no more attention to them; it would even
be a disgrace for him to carry the captured seal on land”<a class="noteRef" id="n252.4src" href="#n252.4">313</a>. This is quite another state of things than what we have seen to exist on the Pacific
Coast, where female labour, especially in the preparation of articles of commerce,
is highly valued.
</p>
<p>7º. <i>Militarism.</i> Among the Greenlanders warfare is unknown<a class="noteRef" id="n252.5src" href="#n252.5">314</a>. Boas, speaking of the Central Eskimos, says: “Real wars or fights between settlements,
I believe, have never happened, but contests have always been confined to single families”<a class="noteRef" id="n252.6src" href="#n252.6">315</a>. In Alaska it is otherwise, for “the Northern Indians are frequently at war with
the Eskimos and Southern Indians, for whom they at all times entertain the most inveterate
hatred”<a class="noteRef" id="n252.7src" href="#n252.7">316</a>. This absence of militarism enables the Greenlanders and Central Eskimos to have
men performing women’s work living among them, as we have seen in § 1 of this chapter<a class="noteRef" id="n252.8src" href="#n252.8">317</a>.
</p>
<p>So the Eskimos, like the slave-keeping Indians of the Pacific Coast, are accomplished
fishers, have fixed habitations, are industrially highly developed, and generally
not warlike. On the other hand there is no abundance of food, wealth does not exist,
and woman’s condition is not nearly so good as on the Pacific Coast. Also in the size
of their groups, the preserving of food, and the development of trade, they are decidedly
<span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>inferior to the slave-keeping tribes of the N.&nbsp;W. Coast of North America.
</p>
<p>The principal cause why the Eskimos do not keep slaves evidently is the difficulty
with which food is procured. We have seen that female labour, being unproductive,
is little valued. Male labour only is indispensable, and this is labour of high quality.
Navigating in the kyak is a matter of much skill. Crantz tells us that Europeans who
tried it, could move about a little in very calm weather; but they were not able to
fish while being in the kyak, nor to save themselves when the least danger occurred.
This requires peculiar skill, and Eskimos take several years to learn it. There are
indeed men unable to capture seals; they are much despised<a class="noteRef" id="n253.1src" href="#n253.1">318</a>. Bancroft also states that considerable skill is required in taking seals<a class="noteRef" id="n253.2src" href="#n253.2">319</a>, and Boas describes at great length the ingenious methods used in seal, walrus, and
whale hunting<a class="noteRef" id="n253.3src" href="#n253.3">320</a>. Unskilled labour is not wanted; and widows and orphans who have lost their bread-winner
may be glad if any one is willing to receive them into his house<a class="noteRef" id="n253.4src" href="#n253.4">321</a>.
</p>
<p>Sometimes an Eskimo wants labour. In Greenland a married couple having no children
at all or no full-grown children, adopt male and female children whom they treat as
their own; the adopted son is considered the future head of the family<a class="noteRef" id="n253.5src" href="#n253.5">322</a>. Among the Central Eskimos too, as to the right of inheritance “an elder adopted
son has a preference over a younger son born of the marriage”<a class="noteRef" id="n253.6src" href="#n253.6">323</a>. Thus we see that a normally constituted family is self-dependent. If there are no
children, their place has to be supplied by strangers; boys have to perform the same
highly skilled labour as the father, and girls to help the mother in her work that,
though less valued, has also to be done. But a further increase of the family by slaves
performing menial work is not wanted; the man, if able, would not be willing to maintain
them. The only kind of work indispensable here cannot be imposed upon slaves; and
the cost of maintaining slaves performing other <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>work would be greater than the profit they would yield. Food is not preserved in such
large quantities as on the Pacific Coast; shell-fish and vegetable food are almost
entirely unknown here; nor is any fish, oil, etc. prepared for commercial purposes.
</p>
<p>There is one more cause at work among the Eskimos, preventing the existence of slavery:
the dependence of labour upon capital. Boas, describing the Central Eskimos, states
that among the adopted people “who may almost be considered servants” there are “men
who have lost their sledges and dogs.” Such servants “fulfil minor occupations, mend
the hunting implements, fit out the sledges, feed the dogs, etc.; sometimes, however,
they join the hunters. They follow the master of the house when he removes from one
place to another, make journeys in order to do his commissions, and so on”<a class="noteRef" id="n254.1src" href="#n254.1">324</a>. And Crantz tells us that among the Greenlanders many boys are neglected in their
youth, as the providing of them with kyak and implements is very costly<a class="noteRef" id="n254.2src" href="#n254.2">325</a>. Among the Indians of the Pacific Coast the possession of capital gives great advantage;
thus among the Makah the owner of the canoe receives a proportionate share of the
booty from the crew<a class="noteRef" id="n254.3src" href="#n254.3">326</a>; but it is not indispensable. Here it is. A man destitute of capital cannot provide
for himself, and is therefore at the mercy of the capitalist. Now the Eskimo capitalist
most often allows such men to share his house and food, and makes them feed the dogs,
etc. rather as means of procuring employment for them, than because such work requires
hands outside the family. The capitalist does not want labourers; but even if he did,
there would always be widows and orphans, and men destitute of capital, who would
readily enter into his service. The Eskimos have to struggle with “unemployment” difficulties,
not with scarcity of hands; therefore a slave-dealer visiting them would not find
a ready sale for his stock-in-trade.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 6.</span> <i>Conclusion.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We shall sum up here the conclusions to which the foregoing paragraphs have led us.
</p>
<p>1º. <i>Hunters</i> hardly ever keep slaves; and when they do slavery is of little moment. But among
<i>fishers</i> slavery often, though by no means always, exists: of the two large groups of fishing
tribes one (the Indians on the Pacific Coast of North America) keeps slaves, the other
(the Eskimos) does not.
</p>
<p>2º. The living in <i>fixed habitations</i> is more favourable to the existence of slavery than <i>nomadism</i>.
</p>
<p>3º. Slavery is most likely to exist among men who live in rather <i>large groups</i>.
</p>
<p>4º. Where <i>food</i> is <i>abundant</i> and easy to procure, slaves can be of more use than where food is scarce; in the
latter case the slave, to use Spencer’s words, “is not worth his food.”
</p>
<p>5º. The <i>preserving of food</i> furthers the growth of slavery.
</p>
<p>6º. <i>Commercial tribes</i>, especially those that carry on a trade in manufactured goods, have more use for
slaves than others. We must, however, bear in mind that trade, even among savages,
does not seem anywhere to be altogether unknown.
</p>
<p>7º. A high development of <i>industry</i> also tends to further the growth of slavery. The instance of the Eskimos, however,
shows that industrial tribes do not always keep slaves.
</p>
<p>8º. Where <i>wealth</i> exists slaves are more likely to be kept than where wealth is unknown.
</p>
<p>9º. Where <i>subsistence</i> is <i>dependent on capital</i>, slaves are not wanted.
</p>
<p>10º. Where only highly <i>skilled labour</i> is required, slaves cannot be of any use.
</p>
<p>11º. <i>Female labour</i> may in some degree serve as a substitute for slave labour (as in Australia). But
where women enjoy much consideration, the men sometimes procure slaves in order to
relieve the women of a part of their task, especially where the women perform productive
labour.
</p>
<p>12º. Where <i>militarism</i> largely prevails, and warriors are more wanted than labourers, slavery is not likely
to exist. Yet in a few cases the same militarism leads to the keeping <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>of slaves, viz. when slaves are kept mainly for military purposes.
</p>
<p>13º. Tribes forming a somewhat <i>homogeneous group</i>, and maintaining constant relations with each other, are more likely, <i lang="la">ceteris paribus</i>, to keep slaves, than an isolated tribe.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>These conclusions, arrived at by an examination of hunting and fishing tribes, all,
except the first, bear a general character. We may therefore suppose that they will
equally apply to pastoral and agricultural tribes. Whether this really be the case,
will appear from the ensuing chapters. It may, however, be convenient first to simplify
and systematically arrange them.
</p>
<p>As the <i>principal factor</i> we may regard the general economic state of society. Two distinctions are to be made
here:
</p>
<p>1º. Subsistence either is or is not dependent on capital.
</p>
<p>2º. Subsistence is either easy or difficult to acquire.
</p>
<p>These two distinctions are independent of each other. For where subsistence depends
on capital, it may, with the aid of capital, be easily acquired or not. Similarly,
where it does not depend on capital, it may be easy or difficult to procure. Accordingly
we find the following forms of economic life:
</p>
<p>1º. Subsistence depends on capital. Without capital a man cannot get on. Now, if labourers
are wanted, there are likely to be people destitute of capital, who have no other
resource left but to offer their labour to the capitalist. But there is a difference,
according as subsistence is easily acquired or not.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Subsistence, even with the aid of capital, is difficult to procure. The procuring
of subsistence requires a combination of capital and skilled labour. Thus among the
Eskimos a man unacquainted with their ingenious hunting and fishing methods cannot
get on any more than a man destitute of a boat, or of sledges and dogs. Here labourers
are not much wanted. Helpless persons are kept as servants, but this is done for pity’s
sake rather than because they are useful. Slavery does not exist.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Subsistence, with the aid of capital, is easy to procure. Unskilled labour, combined
with capital, is so productive that it gives a surplus beyond the subsistence of the
labourer. In this case the capitalist wants labourers, but there are also labourers
<span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>who want the capitalist. We have not yet met with any instance of this state of things.
Slavery can exist here, if the demand for labour exceeds the supply of labour; but
we do not think this will often be the case.
</p>
<p>2º. Subsistence does not depend on capital. We are, of course, aware that a man, to
procure his subsistence, always wants some implements, such as a spear, bow and arrow,
etc. But he does not, therefore, depend on capital; for he can always make a spear
or bow for himself; so after all, he depends only on his own strength and skill. If
an Eskimo loses his boat, he wants a long time to make a new one; in the meantime
he has to live, and so is thrown upon the mercy of others. But where the necessary
implements can always be procured at a moment’s notice, subsistence is not dependent
on capital: the man who has broken his spear can immediately make a new one; he need
not ask anybody to feed him in the meantime<a class="noteRef" id="n257.1src" href="#n257.1">327</a>.
</p>
<p>Subsistence, where it does not depend on capital, is again either easy or difficult
to procure.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Subsistence is not easy to procure; it requires much skill. As subsistence does not
depend on capital, every skilled labourer is able to provide for himself. Those who
are not able providers are dependent on the others; but their labour, being little
productive, is not much valued. Such is the state of things among many hunting tribes.
As slaves cannot be compelled to perform work that requires the utmost skill and application,
slavery cannot exist here.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Subsistence is easy to procure. The produce of unskilled labour can exceed the primary
wants of the labourer. As subsistence is not dependent on capital, everybody is able
to provide for himself; therefore labourers do not voluntarily offer themselves. In
such circumstances a man can, it is true, acquire the products of another’s labour
by producing commodities himself and exchanging them for what another has <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>produced. He can also, like the Makah boat-owner, produce such things as enhance the
productiveness of labour, and lend them to others, stipulating for a part of the profit
for himself. But he cannot make others work under his direction. The common labourer
of modern European societies, in order to get his subsistence, performs the work which
his employer assigns to him. Were he free to choose, he would prefer to work according
to his own inclinations. In countries however, where nobody need apply to another
for employment, there is little chance of people voluntarily submitting to the orders
of employers. In such countries, if there is to be an organization of labour with
subordination under the master of the work, some men must be compelled to work for
others, and we know that one form of compulsory labour is slavery. Therefore, when
subsistence is easy to procure, and not dependent on capital, slave labour can be
of much use. Yet even then slavery does not always exist. We shall see that there
are disturbing factors. But we may now, at least, say that, generally speaking, <i>slavery can only exist when subsistence is easy to procure without the aid of capital</i>.
</p>
<p>There are some additional, or <i>secondary</i>, <i>factors</i> which increase or diminish the use of slave labour.
</p>
<p>1º. It may be, that unskilled labour is required, but is sufficiently performed by
the women. Thus in Australia women gather vegetable food and perform all the common
drudgery; and some Australian tribes subsist mainly on the produce of female labour.
In such cases slaves are not wanted. This is a circumstance of much importance; for
everywhere women are about half, sometimes more than half, of the population. As in
our days, in civilized Europe, the employing of women in factories tends to diminish
the want for male labour and so to keep wages low, so <i>female labour</i> in Australia makes slavery superfluous. The causes on which the division of labour
between the sexes depends cannot be examined here; this would require an investigation
of the whole history of marriage. But, though unable to find the causes, we can trace
the effects of this division of labour. Where women are looked upon as “beasts of
burden” (to use an expression the ethnographers are very fond of), there is not so
much use for slave labour as where <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>they hold a high position and the men are desirous of relieving them of a part of
their task.
</p>
<p>2º. Where <i>food</i> is <i>preserved</i> in large quantities, more work has to be done at a time, viz. in the season of plenty,
than where life is continually a hand-to-mouth proceeding. And the additional work
required for preserving food, <i>e.g.</i> the drying of fish, is very fit to be imposed upon slaves: it requires little skill
and is easy to supervise.
</p>
<p>3º. The development of <i>trade and industry</i> has a great influence. When the freemen wish to devote themselves to these pursuits,
they want others to perform the common drudgery for every-day subsistence. Moreover,
the preparing of the articles of commerce may require menial labour: thus on the Pacific
Coast slaves are employed in drying fish, preparing oil, etc. And finally, trade and
industry lead to the development of wealth. As soon as wealth exists, a man does not
only want food and the other necessaries of life, but also luxuries, so his wants
may become almost unlimited, and there is much more use for slave labour.
</p>
<p>Hitherto we have considered slavery as serving economic purposes. But <i>slaves</i> may also be <i>kept for non-economic purposes</i>. There is only one such purpose we have as yet met with: the <i>employing of slaves in warfare</i>. We have seen that among the Abipones this was the main and almost the only function
of slavery.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it may be that <i>militarism</i> so largely prevails, that all available men are wanted in warfare. If, then, the
military organization is not so highly developed, that slaves can be employed in warfare
without any danger, slavery is not likely to exist, though it might be economically
of great use.
</p>
<p>There are other causes, which we may call <i>external</i>. However much slaves are wanted, there must be a coercive power strong enough to
make the keeping of slaves possible. The following causes tend to increase this coercive
power:
</p>
<p>1º. Living in <i>fixed habitations</i>. Besides the effect this has on the growth of industry, it makes the escape of slaves
more difficult and the surveying of slave labour easier.
</p>
<p>2º. Living together in <i>large groups</i>. In a small group any <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>increase in the number of slaves would soon become dangerous to the maintenance of
power by the freemen within the group, and an escaping slave would soon be out of
reach of the group.
</p>
<p>3º. The <i>preserving of food</i>. Besides having some economic effects of which we have treated above, it makes living
in large groups and in fixed habitations possible; moreover it attaches the slave
to his master’s home; for he knows he will get there sufficient food in the time of
scarcity, whereas, if he escaped, he would have to shift for himself.
</p>
<p>4º. The existence of a somewhat <i>homogeneous group of tribes</i> maintaining constant relations with each other greatly accelerates the growth of
slavery, especially by means of the <i>slave trade</i>. Twenty tribes, living separately, have, each for itself, to invent slavery; but
when twenty tribes maintain relations with each other, as soon as one of them has
invented slavery, the other 19 have it ready-made before them.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n197.4src">28</a></span> Mr. Westermarck observes: “The prevalence of slavery in a savage tribe and the extent
to which it is practised must also depend upon the ability of the tribe to procure
slaves from foreign communities and upon its willingness to allow its own members
to be kept as slaves within the tribe. It may be very useful for a group to have a
certain number of slaves, and yet they may not have them, for the reason that no slaves
are to be had” (Moral Ideas, I p. 674). It will be seen from what we have just said,
that we fully agree with this. For some hunting tribes it might be very useful, in
an economic sense, to keep slaves; but there is a series of social and psychical factors
that render the subjection of men as slaves impossible. We do not think, therefore,
that Mr. Westermarck is quite right in remarking that in our book “the influence of
economic conditions upon the institution of slavery has perhaps been emphasised too
much at the cost of other factors” (Ibid<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n197.4src" title="Return to note 28 in text.">↑</a></p>

more for the sake of trading, than for what they make by it.” Bücher decidedly underrates

derived. Perhaps from the inland tribes who, as Letourneau himself proves to be aware,
have no slaves? Or from the Siberians, who are rather in a lower than in a higher
economic state as compared with the Indians of the Pacific Coast? Or from the Hindus

most men are <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>hardly ever allowed to have a fire on the grate during the winter. The cause of this
imperious behaviour of Ameland women is not difficult to detect: as the men are at
home only in the winter, the women rule for the greater part of the year, and are
not inclined to part with their authority in winter-time. Therefore most men, so to
speak, board at their wives’ houses, and if they want to keep peace, have to put up
with female ascendency.” <span lang="nl">Tegenwoordige Staat der Vereenigde Nederlanden</span>, XIV pp. 363, 364.

<p>We see that there are almost as many positive as negative cases. So those theorists
are wrong, who hold that the taming of animals naturally leads to the taming of men<a class="noteRef" id="n263.1src" href="#n263.1">1</a>.
</p>
<p>It might, however, be that the non-existence of slavery in our negative cases were
due to a special, external cause, viz. that these tribes were so inclosed between
more powerful nations as not to be able to procure slaves, though slaves would be
of much use to them. A brief survey of the political state of these tribes shows that
they are not all in this position. The Kazak Kirghiz, in Levchine’s time, kidnapped
slaves whom they sold abroad. The Massai are very warlike and adopt captives. The
Turkomans are “the intermediate agents for carrying on the slave-trade”<a class="noteRef" id="n263.2src" href="#n263.2">2</a>. The Ama-Xosa and Ama-Zulu are also very warlike<a class="noteRef" id="n263.3src" href="#n263.3">3</a>. We see that there are some pastoral tribes that, though able to procure slaves,
do not keep any. The non-existence of slavery among them must be due to other, more
internal, causes.
</p>
<p>It might also be that our positive cases were exceptions to a general rule. For many
pastoral tribes, though subsisting mainly by cattle-breeding, carry on agriculture
besides. If these only kept slaves, and employed them chiefly in work connected with
agriculture, slavery would prove foreign to pastoral nomadism as such; for then these
tribes would only keep slaves in their quality as agriculturists.
</p>
<p>We shall inquire whether this be so; and for this purpose we shall give a survey of
the work imposed upon slaves among pastoral tribes. This survey, besides enabling
us to decide upon the question at issue, will show what place slavery occupies in
pastoral life.
</p>
<p>Among the Larbas the boys (also free boys) guard the cattle <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>on the pasture-ground, whereas the work that requires more skill (the tending of young
animals, the breaking of horses, etc.) is equally divided between master and slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n264.1src" href="#n264.1">4</a>.
</p>
<p>Circassian slaves, according to Bell, till the soil, tend the cattle and perform domestic
labour. Klaproth, however, states that the peasants may only be sold together with
the land; so they are rather a kind of serfs. Domestic slaves may be sold separately<a class="noteRef" id="n264.2src" href="#n264.2">5</a>.
</p>
<p>According to Roscoe, among the Bahima, “the women’s duties are to wash the milk pots,
perhaps it would be better to say see the pots are washed, because the work generally
falls upon the slaves to perform”<a class="noteRef" id="n264.3src" href="#n264.3">6</a>.
</p>
<p>Munzinger speaks of domestic labour being imposed on slaves by the Beduan. Most of
these slaves are women<a class="noteRef" id="n264.4src" href="#n264.4">7</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Beni Amer it is considered an honour to have many slaves. “Properly speaking
slaves serve their master only when children. Adult female slaves are concubines,
live with their master, but are exempt from nearly all labour; adult male slaves generally
despise all work, and belong to the retinue of the master. The master derives no real
profit from his slaves.” According to Von Müller the fabrication of tar falls to the
share of the slave, such work being below the dignity of a freeman<a class="noteRef" id="n264.5src" href="#n264.5">8</a>.
</p>
<p>Paulitschke tells us that among the nomadic Somal and Danakil slavery is not profitable;
for the territories inhabited by them are thinly peopled, agriculture is insignificant,
and these cattle-breeders get their subsistence rather easily; moreover they would
be unable to support a considerable number of slaves by the produce of their cattle.
Therefore among the Danakil on the river Aussa and the Rahanwîn Somal on the lower
Wêbi-Schabêli, where slaves are employed in agriculture, there is more use for slave
labour. Among the nomadic Somal and Danakil slaves appear also to be employed in warfare.
According to Bottego, whose account applies to the Somal of the towns, adult male
slaves till the soil, build houses, and perform the rudest and most fatiguing kinds
of work. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>boys lead the cattle to the pasture-ground; the women are employed in household work
and often are concubines of their masters<a class="noteRef" id="n265.1src" href="#n265.1">9</a>.
</p>
<p>There are some tribes that subsist mainly on agriculture, but also, to a great extent,
on cattle-breeding. It may be of some use to give a survey of the work done by slaves,
among them too; it will appear, then, whether they keep their slaves for agricultural
purposes only, or employ them also for pastoral work.
</p>
<p>Among the Kafirs some slaves are blacksmiths. In war a slave boy beats the drum<a class="noteRef" id="n265.2src" href="#n265.2">10</a>. Our informant speaks only incidentally of slave labour; he does not mean to say
that this is the only work performed by slaves.
</p>
<p>Among the Barotse young slaves are given as pages to the children of freemen. Slaves
till the soil and tend the cattle; slave boys are employed as herdsmen<a class="noteRef" id="n265.3src" href="#n265.3">11</a>.
</p>
<p>In a description of the Waganda it is said: “One of the principal evils resulting
from slavery in Uganda is that it causes all manual labour to be looked upon as derogatory
to the dignity of a free man”<a class="noteRef" id="n265.4src" href="#n265.4">12</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Mandingoes native-born slaves enjoy much liberty; they tend the cattle,
and go to war, even without their masters. Freemen work as much as slaves. Every Mandingo,
to whatever class he belongs, is occupied in agriculture. The tending of horses is
incumbent on slave boys<a class="noteRef" id="n265.5src" href="#n265.5">13</a>.
</p>
<p>Hildebrandt states that the occupations of the Sakalavas are not many. In North Sakalavaland,
however, rice is cultivated for export, and so there is more labour wanted here; therefore
in this district slavery prevails to a large extent<a class="noteRef" id="n265.6src" href="#n265.6">14</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Bogos there are hardly 200 slaves (whereas Munzinger estimates the total
population at 8400). Slaves are of little use to their owners. Male slaves live separately
and generally take to robbery. Female slaves, having no opportunity to marry, become
prostitutes and live rather independently<a class="noteRef" id="n265.7src" href="#n265.7">15</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Takue have very few slaves. In their laws and customs they show a close resemblance
to the Bogos<a class="noteRef" id="n266.1src" href="#n266.1">16</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the pirate-tribes of Mindanao and Sulu agriculture is incumbent on slaves. The
slaves also share in their masters’ slave-raids. Jansen gives some more details about
the work of slaves in the Sulu Islands. The ordinary occupations of slaves are agriculture,
fishing, manufacture of salt, trade, and domestic work<a class="noteRef" id="n266.2src" href="#n266.2">17</a>.
</p>
<p>The slaves of the Geges and Nagos of Porto Novo are chiefly employed in agriculture<a class="noteRef" id="n266.3src" href="#n266.3">18</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Ossetes the slaves perform household work; the peasants are serfs<a class="noteRef" id="n266.4src" href="#n266.4">19</a>.
</p>
<p>The slaves captured and purchased by the Gallas are generally sold to foreign traders;
in large households they are sometimes retained and employed in various kinds of work.
In another place our informant states that most slaves are employed in agriculture<a class="noteRef" id="n266.5src" href="#n266.5">20</a>.
</p>
<p>Yoruba slaves are employed in trade and warfare<a class="noteRef" id="n266.6src" href="#n266.6">21</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that slaves are employed in agriculture among the agricultural Somal and Danakil,
Fulbe, Barotse, Mandingoes, Sakalavas, pirate-tribes of Mindanao and Sulu, Geges and
Nagos, Gallas; and very probably also among the Waganda, where they perform “all manual
labour.” As the details given by our ethnographers are not always complete, it is
possible that in some more cases slaves are employed in agriculture. But it is sufficiently
clear, that among the Beni Amer, nomadic Somal and Danakil, Bogos, and probably also
among the Beduan and Takue, slaves do not till the soil. Among the Ossetes and Circassians
the peasants are serfs, slaves being employed in household work. What work is incumbent
on slaves among the Aeneze Bedouins we are not told; but agriculture seems to be unknown
among them. Among the Larbas the daily work is equally divided between master and
slaves, agriculture holding a very subordinate place. Hence it appears that several
of these tribes keep slaves, though they do not <span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>employ them in agriculture; pastoral tribes, as such, sometimes keep slaves.
</p>
<p>But another inference we can draw from the foregoing survey of slave labour is this.
Where slaves are not employed in agriculture or in such other work as requires a settled
life (<i>e.g.</i> house-building among the Somal of the towns, fishing and manufacture of salt among
the pirate-tribes of Mindanao and Sulu), the use of slave labour is not great. Among
the Beni Amer, Bogos, and nomadic Somal and Danakil slave-keeping is stated to be
a mere luxury. The Sakalavas, except in the rice-exporting district, do not want much
slave labour. And only in one case, viz. among the Larbas, is it clearly stated that
the chief business of slaves is pastoral work.

<p>This tends to prove, that <i>among true pastoral tribes slavery, as a system of labour, is of little moment</i>. This inference is verified by several statements about slaves being often manumitted
or in the course of time becoming practically free.
</p>
<p>Burckhardt, speaking of the slaves of the Aeneze Bedouins, says: “After a certain
lapse of time they are always emancipated, and married to persons of their own colour”<a class="noteRef" id="n267.1src" href="#n267.1">22</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Circassians slaves are often manumitted. A slave can also purchase his freedom,
and then becomes a member of a Circassian fraternity<a class="noteRef" id="n267.2src" href="#n267.2">23</a>.
</p>
<p>The Beni Amer have two kinds of slaves, newly-purchased and native-born. “Their condition
differs so much, that only the former may properly be called slaves; the latter are
rather serfs. The newly-purchased slave is treated like every Mohammedan slave, he
may be sold and does not yet belong to the family. The native-born slave has only
the name, not the state of a slave; this appears from his being allowed to intermarry
with the Woreza (subjected class). The children born of such a marriage are considered
free, as they descend from a free mother. In Barka the Kishendoa, <i>i.e.</i> native-born slaves, who inhabit a camp of tents of their own, are governed by a chief
who is one of their own number, and intermarry with the Woreza. Native-born slaves
may live where they like and have the same right of inheritance as freemen; only if
such <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>a slave leaves no relatives does the master succeed to his goods.… In the blood-feud
too the native-born slave is in a peculiar condition. If a newly-purchased slave is
killed, his price is restored to his owner; for such a slave is looked upon as an
article of trade. The native-born slave, however, belongs to the family; therefore
his blood requires blood; he is avenged by his relatives if there are such, and otherwise
by his master; if this is not practicable because the murderer is a man of power,
the matter is hushed up; but a compensation is never given”<a class="noteRef" id="n268.1src" href="#n268.1">24</a>.
</p>
<p>The Somal often buy slaves whom they manumit soon afterwards<a class="noteRef" id="n268.2src" href="#n268.2">25</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Kafirs of India each tribe is governed by a council. Even slaves can be
elected as members of this council<a class="noteRef" id="n268.3src" href="#n268.3">26</a>.
</p>
<p>Our survey of the work done by slaves shows in the third place, that slaves are often
employed in warfare. This will be accounted for later on.
</p>
<p>Here we have only to emphasize the fact, that to pastoral tribes as such slave labour
is of little use. This makes it easy to understand why so many of them dispense with
slavery altogether.
</p>
<p>Going on to inquire what is the cause of this phenomenon, we may remember the general
conclusion we have arrived at in the last paragraph, viz. that slave labour is of
little use, where subsistence is either dependent on capital, or very difficult to
procure. Now it is easy to see that among pastoral tribes subsistence entirely depends
on capital. Among people who live upon the produce of their cattle, a man who owns
no cattle, <i>i.e.</i> no capital, has no means of subsistence. Accordingly, among pastoral tribes we find
rich and poor men; and the poor often offer themselves as labourers to the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n268.4src" href="#n268.4">27</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Syrian Bedouins “to every tent, or to every two or three tents, there is
a shepherd or person to attend the cattle, either a younger son or servant; he receives
wages for ten months”<a class="noteRef" id="n268.5src" href="#n268.5">28</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the Larbas alms are given to the poor. The social rank of the head of a family
depends on the number of his children, his practical knowledge of the pastoral art,
and his wealth. There are free labourers who are paid in kind. Herdsmen have the usufruct
of a part of the herds they tend. Generally the labourer takes a tenth in kind at
the close of the time agreed upon; moreover he receives his daily food during the
time of his engagement<a class="noteRef" id="n269.1src" href="#n269.1">29</a>.
</p>
<p>Levchine, speaking of the Kazak Kirghiz, tells us: “Once I asked a Kirghiz, owner
of 8000 horses, why he did not sell every year a part of his stud. He answered: “Why
should I sell that which is my pleasure? I want no money; if I had any, I should be
obliged to shut it up in a box, where nobody would see it; but when my steeds run
over the steppe everybody looks at them; everybody knows that they are mine; and people
always remember that I am rich.” In this manner is the reputation of being a rich
man acquired throughout the hordes; such is the wealth that procures them the regard
of their countrymen and the title of <i>baï</i> (rich man), which sometimes gives them an ascendency over the offspring of the khans
and the most deserving old men.” On the other hand the number of beggars is very considerable.
Levchine makes no mention of servants; but Radloff, who about thirty years later visited
the Kazak Kirghiz, says: “There exists here a class of servants, whom I found in every
well-to-do family. The herds are generally tended by hired herdsmen, who are subjected
to a kind of supervision.” The rich also engage poor families to till their lands.
A man who loses all his cattle has no resource left but to offer himself as a labourer<a class="noteRef" id="n269.2src" href="#n269.2">30</a>.
</p>
<p>The same first-rate ethnographer informs us that among the Altaians “rich and poor
eat the same kind of food; the difference is only in the size of the kettle and the
quantity of food. The poor man eats what he has got, which most frequently is very
little; and he would starve but that the rich have such an abundance of food, that
in summer they readily entertain whoever comes to their <i>jurts</i> (tents).” When a beast <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>is being killed, the poor neighbours in large numbers throng towards the place and
try to secure those portions of the bowels that the rich disdain; they have to fight
for them with the dogs, who are equally fond of the delicacies. When all guests have
been served, pieces of meat are thrown towards the door, where poor men and dogs try
to secure them. The picked bones are also thrown to the poor, who clean them so thoroughly
that nothing but the bare bone is left to the dogs. The cattle of the rich are generally
tended by poor neighbours, who live in the vicinity of the rich, partake of their
food, and receive their worn clothes. Young girls often seek employment as servants;
orphans of poor men also serve the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n270.1src" href="#n270.1">31</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Kalmucks there are poor people who serve the rich as herdsmen<a class="noteRef" id="n270.2src" href="#n270.2">32</a>.
</p>
<p>Prschewalsky states that rich Mongols, who own thousands of beasts, employ herdsmen
who are poor and have no relations<a class="noteRef" id="n270.3src" href="#n270.3">33</a>.
</p>
<p>The Kurds of Eriwan employ freemen as herdsmen<a class="noteRef" id="n270.4src" href="#n270.4">34</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Tunguz the poor generally serve the rich, by whom they are badly treated<a class="noteRef" id="n270.5src" href="#n270.5">35</a>.
</p>
<p>Yakuts, who have less than one head of cattle per soul, must hire themselves out for
wages<a class="noteRef" id="n270.6src" href="#n270.6">36</a>.
</p>
<p>Pallas says: “Every Samoyede has his reindeer and tends them himself with the help
of his family, except the very rich who employ poor men as herdsmen.” Von Stenin also
states that the poor serve the rich. The following anecdote, given by this writer,
shows how strongly the desire of wealth influences psychical life among the Samoyedes.
One of them depicted the delight of intoxication in these terms: “Spirits taste better
than meat. When a man is drunk, he fancies he has many reindeer and thinks himself
a merchant. But on coming to his senses he sees that he is poor and has just spent
his last reindeer in drinking”<a class="noteRef" id="n270.7src" href="#n270.7">37</a>.
</p>
<p>Of the Koryakes we are told: “Before they were subjected <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>by the Russians, they had neither government nor magistrates; only the rich exercised
some authority over the poor.” Their greatest pleasure consists in looking at their
herds. The poor are employed in tending the herds of the rich for food and clothing;
if they have themselves some reindeer, they are allowed to join them to their master’s
herds and tend them together with the latter<a class="noteRef" id="n271.1src" href="#n271.1">38</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Tuski, according to Georgi, the poor serve the rich as herdsmen<a class="noteRef" id="n271.2src" href="#n271.2">39</a>.
</p>
<p>In North-East Africa the state of things is not quite the same. The pastoral nomads
here form the nobility, and tax subjected tribes with tributes and compulsory labour.
Servants are not found here so often as in Asia. Sometimes, however, they are found.
Thus among the Beni Amer there are herdsmen, maid-servants etc. who work for wages<a class="noteRef" id="n271.3src" href="#n271.3">40</a>. The same, perhaps, applies to the Massai, where the man who owns large herds and
many wives, enjoys high consideration but a poor man is despised<a class="noteRef" id="n271.4src" href="#n271.4">41</a>.
</p>
<p>“Among all South African natives” says Fritsch “the rich tyrannize over the poor who,
in the hope of filling their stomachs, comply with a state of dependence that is not
authorized by law”<a class="noteRef" id="n271.5src" href="#n271.5">42</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Caffres poor men place themselves under the protection of a rich head of
a family, build their huts in his kraal, and in reward yield their cattle to him<a class="noteRef" id="n271.6src" href="#n271.6">43</a>.
</p>
<p>Kropf tells us that among the Ama-Xosa the consideration a man enjoys depends on the
number of cattle he owns. The poor are fed by the chief and in return render him services<a class="noteRef" id="n271.7src" href="#n271.7">44</a>.
</p>
<p>The Ovaherero despise any one who has no cattle. The rich support many people, who
become their dependents, and so they acquire distinction and power<a class="noteRef" id="n271.8src" href="#n271.8">45</a>. The children of impoverished families who, according to Andersson<a class="noteRef" id="n271.9src" href="#n271.9">46</a>, are kept as slaves, are perhaps rather to be called servants.
</p>
<p>Among those tribes which are mainly agricultural, but besides <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>subsist largely upon the produce of their cattle, similar phenomena present themselves.
</p>
<p>Among the Ossetes freemen are often employed as servants<a class="noteRef" id="n272.1src" href="#n272.1">47</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Bechuanas the possession of cattle and a waggon is a mark of distinction.
They mix their porridge with curdled milk, and therefore call a poor man a water-porridge
man<a class="noteRef" id="n272.2src" href="#n272.2">48</a>.
</p>
<p>Casalis gives an elaborate description of the value which the Basutos attach to the
possession of cattle. Wealth, among them, consists in cattle, and this wealth is the
base of the power of the chiefs. By means of the produce of their herds they feed
the poor, procure arms for the warriors, support the troops in war and entertain good
relations with neighbouring nations. Were a chief to lose his cattle, his power would
be at an end<a class="noteRef" id="n272.3src" href="#n272.3">49</a>.
</p>
<p>The Barotse employ as herdsmen young slaves and sons of poor men<a class="noteRef" id="n272.4src" href="#n272.4">50</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Dinka every man upon an average owns three head of cattle; but there are
also poor men, who are the slaves or servants of the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n272.5src" href="#n272.5">51</a>. We may safely infer that these “slaves or servants” are servants and not slaves.
</p>
<p>The sheikh of each Chillook tribe, according to Chaillé Long, detains as slaves those
who do not own even a single cow<a class="noteRef" id="n272.6src" href="#n272.6">52</a>. Probably the same state of things prevails here as among the Caffres: these poor
men are not slaves, but compelled by hunger to seek the protection of a rich man.
</p>
<p>In the country of the Gallas the value of labour is very small<a class="noteRef" id="n272.7src" href="#n272.7">53</a>.
</p>
<p>The Bogos employ freemen as herdsmen and peasants; they also keep maid-servants<a class="noteRef" id="n272.8src" href="#n272.8">54</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Amahlubi there are herdsmen, who serve for wages<a class="noteRef" id="n272.9src" href="#n272.9">55</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that, wherever men subsist by cattle-breeding, a peculiar characteristic of
economic life presents itself. This characteristic is not the existence of wealth;
for wealth also exists among the tribes of the Pacific Coast of North America; yet
on the Pacific Coast slave labour is of great use. It is the <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>existence of poverty. On the Pacific Coast the “abundant natural supplies in ocean,
stream, and forest” enable each man, be he rich or not, to provide for himself; but
among pastoral tribes the means of subsistence are the property of individuals; and
those who own no cattle have no resource but to apply to the owners for support<a class="noteRef" id="n273.1src" href="#n273.1">56</a>. Therefore, if labourers are wanted, there are always freemen who readily offer their
services; and there is no great use for slave labour<a class="noteRef" id="n273.2src" href="#n273.2">57</a>.
</p>
<p>So there is always a supply of labour. On the other hand, the demand for labour is
small. There is but little work to be done. Among some pastoral tribes the men spend
a great deal of time in idleness<a class="noteRef" id="n273.3src" href="#n273.3">58</a>.
</p>
<p>Prschewalsky, speaking of the Mongols, remarks: “Unlimited laziness is a main characteristic
of the nomads; they spend their whole life in idleness, which is furthered by the
character of pastoral nomadism. The tending of the cattle is the sole occupation of
the Mongol, and this does not nearly require all his time. The guarding of cows and
sheep is the business of the women and grown-up children; milking, creaming, butter-making
and other domestic labour falls almost entirely to the share of the mistress of the
house. The men generally do nothing, and from morning till night ride from one <i>jurt</i> (tent) to another, drinking <i>koumiss</i> and chattering with their neighbours. The chase, which the nomads are passionately
fond of, serves mainly as a pastime.”
</p>
<p>The Altaians have to survey the cattle; this consists only in riding a few times a
day to the herds, and driving them together. The milking of the mares during the summer,
which requires some courage, is also the men’s business.
</p>
<p>Among the Aeneze Bedouins the men’s sole business is feeding the horses, and in the
evening milking the camels<a class="noteRef" id="n273.4src" href="#n273.4">59</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kazak Kirghiz, too, are very lazy. They pass a great part of the summer sleeping
because of the warmth; and in winter-time they hardly ever leave their tents, because
the snow covers the roads. As they are not acquainted with any arts, and the tending
of the cattle is their only occupation, there is no need for much work<a class="noteRef" id="n274.1src" href="#n274.1">60</a>.
</p>
<p>Rowney tells us of the Mairs and Meenas of Rajpootana: “The ostensible occupation
followed by them was that of goatherds; but the herds were usually left to the charge
of their boys and old men, while the more able-bodied spent their time, mounted on
their ponies, in marauding, plundering, and murdering”<a class="noteRef" id="n274.2src" href="#n274.2">61</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Massai the men despise every kind of work. Only warfare is considered an
occupation worthy of a man<a class="noteRef" id="n274.3src" href="#n274.3">62</a>.
</p>
<p>It has to be remarked that most of these tribes do not keep slaves; so it is not by
imposing all the work upon slaves that the men are enabled to pass their time in idleness;
yet they do almost nothing. “The herdsman is lazy,” says Schmoller<a class="noteRef" id="n274.4src" href="#n274.4">63</a>, and Schurtz speaks of the aversion from all hard and regular work, which characterizes
the pastoral nomads<a class="noteRef" id="n274.5src" href="#n274.5">64</a>. This proves that but little labour is wanted. One might object, that perhaps women
and boys are overworked. But the fact that the able-bodied men, who form a considerable
part of the community, can afford to take life so very easily, sufficiently proves
that the total amount of labour required is rather small.
</p>
<p>Here we find one more reason why pastoral tribes have little use for slave labour.
The demand for labour is small; therefore, even if free labourers were not available,
only a few slaves would be wanted. Capital is here the principal factor of production,
labour holding a subordinate place. Among agricultural tribes, when there is a practically
unlimited supply of fertile soil, every person whose labour is available to the tribe
can cultivate a piece of ground, and so, the more people there are, the more food
can be produced. But among pastoral tribes, as soon as there are people enough within
the tribe to guard the cattle, milk the cows, and do the other <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>work required, an increase in the number of labourers is not profitable. There is
only a limited demand for labour; therefore, though there may be a temporary scarcity
of labour which makes strengthening of the labour forces of the tribe by means of
slaves desirable,—when a few slaves have been procured, the point at which a further
increase in the number of people gives no profit will soon be reached again.
</p>
<p>We see that among pastoral tribes little labour is required; and such as is, is easy
to procure; for there are always people destitute of capital, who offer themselves
as labourers. Therefore slaves are economically of little use.
</p>
<p>There is, however, one description of a pastoral tribe, in which it is stated, that
men as well as women have to work very hard. This is Geoffroy’s capital monography
on the Larbas. The head of the family and his sons have to guard the herds, trace
and dig pits, share in all operations common to the horsemen of the tribe: raids and
battles, the pursuing of thieves, the defense of the pecuniary interests of the family,
the depositing of merchandise in the <i>ksours</i> (store-houses). The head of the family tends the sick animals, and has the administration
of the wool and grain; but practically he will not have much to do with these matters,
not considering them worth his attention. But a great part of his time is taken up
with keeping watch and marching, and this makes his life a rather hard one. He does
not sleep at night; he waters the cattle in the pits or <i>r’dirs</i>; he surrounds his tents with a protecting hedge, the <i>zirba</i>; he struggles against the elements, which often disperse beasts, tents and men. Daily,
from the cradle to the tomb, the nomad’s life is a struggle for existence. As a child
he already has to look after the cattle; he learns to ride on horseback with his father.
When older, whether rich or poor, he has to learn, for several years, to conduct large
numbers of cattle, which is a very difficult and dangerous work, to tend the different
kinds of animals, to cure them, to sell them, to derive from them as much profit as
possible. Pastoral art is more complicated than at first sight it seems, and comprehends
a long series of accomplishments. At twenty years the nomad is an accomplished man,
thoroughly acquainted with the life he has to lead, enjoying all the physical <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>strength indispensable in the exceptional <i>milieu</i> where he has to struggle. The two youngest sons of the head of the family our informant
describes, 15 and 13 years of age, now perform in the family the duties of herdsmen.
Daily occupations of master and slaves are the driving together of the dispersed animals,
the tending of the females that have calved, the preparing of special food for the
young animals, the dressing of the stronger ones for the saddle and pack-saddle, and
the chase of hares and gazelles<a class="noteRef" id="n276.1src" href="#n276.1">65</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that pastoral life is not so easy here as on the fertile plains of Central
Asia. But the work that is most necessary here, and also most difficult, is the care
for the security of the tribe and its possessions, or, as Geoffroy very appropriately
expresses it, “<i lang="fr">c’est un peu toujours comme la guerre</i>”. And this work cannot be left to slaves; else the slaves would become the masters
of the tribe. Warriors are wanted here; labourers not so much.
</p>
<p>We have now accounted for the non-existence of slavery among many pastoral tribes,
and the little use of slave labour among pastoral tribes in general, by the principle
laid down in the last paragraph, that, generally speaking, slaves are not wanted where
subsistence depends upon capital.
</p>
<p>In North-East Africa, however, there is one more cause at work, making slavery superfluous.
This is the existence of a kind of <i>substitute for slavery</i>, viz. <i>subjection of tribes as such</i>. Pastoral tribes often levy tributes on agricultural tribes, to which they are superior
in military strength; the latter cannot easily leave the lands they cultivate and
seek a new country; if not too heavily oppressed, they will prefer paying a tribute.
And to pastoral nomads the levying of a tax on agricultural tribes brings far more
profit than the enslaving of individuals belonging to such tribes, whom they would
have to employ either in pastoral labour, which they do not want, or in tilling the
soil, which work the nomads would be unable to supervise. There are also pastoral
tribes subjected by other pastoral nomads, the latter forming the nobility and the
military part of society. Finally we find subjected tribes of hunters, smiths, <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>etc.; here we have sometimes rather to deal with a voluntary division of labour<a class="noteRef" id="n277.1src" href="#n277.1">66</a>.
</p>
<p>The Somal have several pariah castes. Among the Wer-Singellis in North Somaliland
we find the following: 1º. Midgân, smiths and traders; these, by acquiring considerable
wealth, sometimes win so much regard, that even a Somali noble deigns to marry his
daughter to a Midgân. 2º. Tómal, who are employed by Somali nobles as servants, herdsmen
and camel-drivers, and are also obliged to go to war. The noble Wer-Singelli carries
sword and spear, whereas the Tomali uses bow and arrows; sometimes a Midgân girl is
given him as a wife, but never the daughter of a noble Somali. The Tómal, however,
belong to the tribe. 3º. Jibbir, who are very much despised. They have no fixed habitations;
they roam in families over the country, from tribe to tribe, as jugglers and magic
doctors. Everybody, for fear of sorcery, gives them food and presents, and in return
receives from them amulets, made of stone and roots. They contract no marriage outside
their own caste<a class="noteRef" id="n277.2src" href="#n277.2">67</a>.
</p>
<p>The Massai, true warriors and raiders, “keep a subjected tribe, the Wa-rombutta, who
do their hunting and what meagre agriculture they indulge in. This tribe is insignificant
in appearance, and although servile and subject to the Massai are not slaves; they
present almost the appearance of dwarfs.” The Wandorobo too, according to Thomson,
are regarded by the Massai as a kind of serfs, and treated accordingly; and Johnston
calls them a helot race of hunters and smiths<a class="noteRef" id="n277.3src" href="#n277.3">68</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Bogos “patronage results from military subjection or from the helpless state
of separate immigrants with regard to a strong and closely united nation. As the nobles
carefully trace their pedigrees, it is easy to find out the Tigres. Tigre means a
man of Ethiopian extraction, who speaks the Tigre language. Some Tigre families, subjected
from time immemorial, have immigrated together with the family of Gebre Terke [the
legendary ancestor of the Bogos]. Others already lived in <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>the country, and unable to withstand the invasion, hastened to submit in order to
be tolerated. The Bogos seem to have taken possession of the country in a very pacific
and forbearing way, and unlike the Normans and other European invaders, do not interfere
with the regulation of landed property, so that the ancient aborigines still own most
of the land. The third class is composed of foreign families who, being for some reason
unable to agree with their countrymen, settle in the country of the Bogos and place
themselves under their protection, which still continually occurs. A member of the
Boas family [<i>i.e.</i> of the Bogos nobility], however poor and weak, never becomes a Tigre; his origin
is a guarantee of his independence. A Tigre, however mighty and rich, cannot become
a Schmagilly [noble]; for the Tigres, who are a compound of various elements, cannot
trace their origin so far back as the Schmagillies who pretend to spring all from
the same ancestor. Moreover, the oppression is so slight, that a revolution is unimaginable”<a class="noteRef" id="n278.1src" href="#n278.1">69</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Takue the state of the Tigres is the same as among the Bogos; formerly they
brought beer to their lords; now they pay them a small tribute of corn and fat<a class="noteRef" id="n278.2src" href="#n278.2">70</a>.
</p>
<p>Marea Tigres have a harder lot. Two kinds of obligations are incumbent on them: towards
their respective masters, and towards the nobility <i>en bloc</i>. Even the poorest noble never becomes a Tigre, and does not perform degrading work,
such as for instance milking. The Tigre pays his master yearly 8 bottles of fat, a
measure of corn, and every week a leathern bag with milk. Of every cow killed by a
Tigre the master receives a considerable portion; a cow belonging to a Tigre, which
dies a natural death, falls entirely to the master. As for the Tigres’ obligations
towards the nobility as a whole, on several occasions they have to give up their cattle
for the nobility. Among the Black Marea the Tigres own most of the land; among the
Red Marea the greater part of the land is in the hands of impoverished nobles, who
live chiefly upon the rent of their landed property. Another class are the Dokono,
who are obliged to choose a patron and pay a tribute, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>are held in rather high esteem and often marry daughters of the nobles; they own land
and herds and are much given to trading<a class="noteRef" id="n279.1src" href="#n279.1">71</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Beni Amer the same distinction, of nobles and subjects, prevails. The latter
are called Woréza. “We shall speak of master and servant,” says Munzinger “though
the latter term does not quite answer the purpose. The state of things we are going
to describe much resembles that which we have met with among the aristocrats of the
Anseba; among the Beni Amer, however, the servant is a feoffee rather than a protégé.
But as he derives his wealth from his master, to whom he owes what we may call interest,
his state is one of much greater dependence.… Among the Beni Amer it is an ancient
custom, that a lord distributes his wealth among his servants; <i>e.g.</i> if he receives 100 cows as his portion of the spoils of war, he does not add them
to his herd, but leaves them to his servants as a present. When the servant marries,
the lord presents him with a camel. In every emergency the servant applies to his
lord, who helps him whenever possible. All these presents become the true property
of the recipient; the servant may do with them as he likes, sell and even spend them;
the lord may upbraid him for it, but legally has nothing to do with it. On the death
of the servant the presents devolve upon his heirs. But the lord has a kind of usufruct
of these presents; the servant provides him with fat and daily brings him a certain
quantity of milk, <i>i.e.</i> he feeds the lord and his family. Often has the lord to wait for his supper till
midnight, because the servant provides for himself first. The servant, moreover, has
to provide the funeral sacrifice for his lord and for every member of the latter’s
family; he leaves to the lord every sterile cow, and when he kills a beast he brings
him the breast-piece. He stands by his lord in every emergency, and even assists him
according to his means towards paying the tribute”. The servant is, so to speak, a
tenant of his lord. As the Beni Amer are nomads, there is no land to distribute; the
pasture has no owner; therefore the fief can only consist in movable property. As
most of the wealth of the country is <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>in the hands of the servants, they have a decisive voice in every public council;
they have to find out where the best pastures are, where the camp has to be erected<a class="noteRef" id="n280.1src" href="#n280.1">72</a>.
</p>
<p>Similar phenomena present themselves outside North-East Africa.
</p>
<p>In the second chapter of Part I we have met with subjected tribes in South Africa,
such as Fengu, Makalahiri, etc., sometimes called slaves by our ethnographers<a class="noteRef" id="n280.2src" href="#n280.2">73</a>.
</p>
<p>Geoffroy speaks of settled tribes being in some way the vassals of the Larbas. The
<i>ksours</i> are buildings in which the nomads preserve their corn, dates and wool; these stores
are guarded by settled tribes, that permanently live there and receive one tenth of
the preserved stock yearly. The nomads look upon all settled tribes as degenerate
beings and inferiors<a class="noteRef" id="n280.3src" href="#n280.3">74</a>. Here we have to deal with a voluntary division of labour, rather than with subjection.
</p>
<p>In Circassia, according to Bell, the serfs are prisoners of war and the ancient inhabitants
of the country. The latter are perhaps the same peasants who, according to Klaproth,
may not be sold apart from the land<a class="noteRef" id="n280.4src" href="#n280.4">75</a>.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that in Central Asia and Siberia we do not find a single instance
of this subjection of tribes as such<a class="noteRef" id="n280.5src" href="#n280.5">76</a>. This is probably the reason why in these parts members of the tribe are so often
employed as servants.
</p>
<p>Where nearly all work is left to subjected tribes or castes, and the nobles do nothing
but fight, there is not much use for slave labour. The nobles do not want slaves,
because all work required by them is performed by their subjects.
</p>
<p>We have now found a new cause, from which in some cases slaves are not wanted: the
subjection of tribes as such, which serves as a substitute for slavery.
</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 2.</span> <i>Slavery among pastoral tribes.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Yet several pastoral tribes keep slaves; this has still to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb281a">[<a href="#pb281a">281</a>]</span>accounted for. We shall inquire first, whether the <i>secondary causes</i> we have found in the last paragraph are at work here.
</p>
<p>1º. <i>Condition of women.</i> On the Pacific Coast of North America the men sometimes procure slaves, in order
to relieve the women of a part of their task. There are some details on record suggestive
of the same state of things among some pastoral tribes. Among the Circassians, Bahima
and Beduan (pastoral tribes), Waganda, pirate-tribes of Mindanao and Sulu, Ossetes
and Gallas (agricultural tribes depending largely on cattle for their subsistence),
slaves are employed for household work. The same is the case with female slaves among
the Larbas and Somal of the towns. Munzinger states that only few Beduan are rich
enough to keep a female slave or a maid-servant; therefore in most families the preparing
of food falls to the share of the wife, this being almost her only occupation<a class="noteRef" id="n281.1src" href="#n281.1">77</a>. Hence we may infer that among the Beduan, and probably among some other tribes,
slaves are procured by the men for the benefit of the women.
</p>
<p>2º. <i>Preserving of food.</i> This does not seem to require much labour among pastoral tribes. On the Pacific Coast
of North America the fish have to be prepared for winter use. But where men live upon
the products of their cattle, food is not at one time much more abundant than at another.
</p>
<p>3º. <i>Trade and industry.</i> Household work, sometimes performed by slaves, does not seem to serve the purposes
of trade, as on the Pacific Coast; there is not a single detail on record, that would
lead us to suppose that it does. We even find particulars tending to prove the contrary.
Among the Beni Amer, who have many slaves, the women are continually occupied in making
mats, the proceeds of which labour are often sufficient to pay the tribute to the
Turks<a class="noteRef" id="n281.2src" href="#n281.2">78</a>. Slaves do not seem to join in this occupation.
</p>
<p>Among the Larbas free women manufacture tissues, which are sold abroad<a class="noteRef" id="n281.3src" href="#n281.3">79</a>. Probably slaves are not capable of performing such fine work.
</p>
<p>Among the Yorubas and pirate-tribes of Mindanao and Sulu <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>the slaves are occupied in trading. But these tribes are not nomadic; moreover, these
slaves do not, like the slaves on the Pacific Coast, prepare the articles of commerce,
but are themselves the traders, which is quite another thing.
</p>
<p>4º. <i>Slaves wanted as warriors.</i> Slaves sometimes serve to augment the military strength of the community. From the
survey of the work done by slaves, given in the beginning of this chapter, it appears
that they are often employed in warfare, viz. among the nomadic Somal and Danakil,
Kafirs, pirate-tribes of Mindanao and Sulu, Mandingoes and Yorubas; probably also
among the Bogos, where they generally take to robbery. Circassian slaves cannot be
compelled to go to war<a class="noteRef" id="n282.1src" href="#n282.1">80</a>. Hence it seems to follow that they may go if they like. Among the Beni Amer native-born
slaves are avenged by their own relatives; so these slaves are armed, and probably
fight together with their masters.
</p>
<p>The ensuing statement strikingly shows how highly slaves are valued as warriors among
the nomadic Somal and Danakil. If a slave kills one enemy, he becomes free; if two
or more, he is entitled to being adopted. Having killed ten enemies, he becomes a
person of rank and enjoys many privileges<a class="noteRef" id="n282.2src" href="#n282.2">81</a>.
</p>
<p>In these cases slaves strengthen the military force of the tribe. But the tribe profits
only indirectly by this reinforcement of the family. Most pastoral nomads live in
comparatively small groups, rather independently; there is no strong central government<a class="noteRef" id="n282.3src" href="#n282.3">82</a>. And where quarrels between these small groups are frequent, the more numerous the
family (in the wider sense, the Roman <i lang="la">familia</i>, including slaves), the better will the head of the family be able to maintain his
position<a class="noteRef" id="n282.4src" href="#n282.4">83</a>. And pastoral nomads have always a great motive for fighting: they can enrich themselves
by a successful raid. Among hunting, fishing, and agricultural tribes, if the conqueror
does not want to keep the vanquished as slaves, war gives little profit<a class="noteRef" id="n282.5src" href="#n282.5">84</a>. But <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>in the raids pastoral nomads make on each other, the successful raider may acquire
numerous herds, <i>i.e.</i> great wealth. Therefore it is of the utmost importance for a man to have as numerous
a <i lang="la">familia</i> as possible.
</p>
<p>When speaking of the Larbas, we have seen that their mode of life is <i lang="fr">un peu toujours comme la guerre</i>. Their describer states: “Theft is the most threatening evil the nomad has to deal
with; he is therefore most severe in suppressing it, the punishment being invariably
death.” He also speaks of free servants, members of the family, who live under the
protection and at the expense of some rich head of a family; they are generally very
numerous, and form a body of clients that strengthens their patron’s power<a class="noteRef" id="n283.1src" href="#n283.1">85</a>.
</p>
<p>Levchine, speaking of the Kazak Kirghiz, says: “Their feuds are caused by the unrestrained
desire for plunder, that ruins and entirely demoralizes them; this plundering is called
<i>baranta</i>, These <i>barantas</i> consist in reciprocal cattle-stealing, from which often sanguinary combats result.…
And we must not think that public hatred or contempt falls on those who are addicted
to these horrible excesses; on the contrary, they enjoy a reputation for bravery,
and are distinguished by the name of <i>Batyr</i> or <i>Boghatyr</i>, which name spreads through all the hordes the fame of their exploits. Many of these
braves, called <i>Batyr</i> for their plundering ardour, though many years dead, still live in the remembrance
of their countrymen, and their names are celebrated.” Accordingly, one of the qualities
required in a chief is a large family, that gives him the power to maintain his authority<a class="noteRef" id="n283.2src" href="#n283.2">86</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Beni Amer, where it seems to be quite an ordinary thing for a noble to receive
100 cows as his portion of the spoils of war, it is a great support for a man to have
many children, as in these countries family is opposed to family<a class="noteRef" id="n283.3src" href="#n283.3">87</a>.
</p>
<p>A writer of the 18<sup>th</sup> century tells us that “the Chukchi who live to the north of the river Anadir, are
not subjected to the Russian empire, and often make raids on those brought under Russian
control, on the Koryakes as well as on the Chukchi, <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>killing or making prisoners all they meet, and carrying off their herds of reindeer”<a class="noteRef" id="n284.1src" href="#n284.1">88</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>Among the Somal and Gallas internal wars are very frequent; among the former most
wars are marauding expeditions. And here too the possession of wife and children is
indispensable; an unmarried man cannot attain to wealth and power<a class="noteRef" id="n284.2src" href="#n284.2">89</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Ama-Xosa and Ovaherero the chief object of warfare is cattle-stealing. Fugitives
from other tribes are never delivered up by the Ama-Xosa, whatever the reason of their
flight; for they strengthen the chief’s power. Another fact, showing the great importance
they attach to the numerical strength of their tribe, is this, that he who kills a
man or woman <span class="corr" id="xd32e15798" title="Source: bij">by</span> accident has to pay a fine to the chief, as a compensation for the loss suffered
<span class="corr" id="xd32e15801" title="Source: bij">by</span> the government of the tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n284.3src" href="#n284.3">90</a>.
</p>
<p>We have already seen that the Massai are “true warriors and raiders” and that the
Mairs and Meenas spend their time in “marauding, plundering and murdering”<a class="noteRef" id="n284.4src" href="#n284.4">91</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that among these tribes everybody is desirous of having as many people about
him as possible for the protection of his own property and the capturing of his neighbour’s.
And a convenient means of procuring such people is the purchase of slaves.
</p>
<p>There is one more secondary cause here, which we have not met with before. It is sometimes
stated that keeping slaves is a mere <i>luxury</i>. Now rich nomads, like all rich people, love luxury. Like the rich Kazak Kirghiz
who told Levchine that the possession of over 8000 horses procured him a reputation
among his countrymen, many rich nomads will win renown by possessing a large retinue
of slaves. Thus for instance we know that among the Beni Amer slave labour is of little
use; yet it is stated, that the Beni Amer are ambitious to possess many slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n284.5src" href="#n284.5">92</a>. And slaves are preferable, as objects of luxury, to free servants. For slaves, generally
acquired from beyond the limits of the tribe, are much more apt to gratify the pride
of the rich man by their submission, than poor freemen, <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>who are always conscious of their <span class="corr" id="xd32e15822" title="Source: memberschip">membership</span> of the tribe and unwilling to be trampled down. The latter fact is proved by several
statements of ethnographers.
</p>
<p>If a rich Samoyede refuses to give his poor countryman a reindeer for food, the latter
has the right to carry off one or more from the rich man’s herd; the law does not
give the owner any hold upon him<a class="noteRef" id="n285.1src" href="#n285.1">93</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Yakuts, according to Müller, the rich sustain their poor fellow-tribesmen;
if the latter lose their reindeer, they are indemnified by the rich. Another writer
tells us that the poor, when dying of hunger, refrain from slaughtering an animal,
from fear of losing their independence<a class="noteRef" id="n285.2src" href="#n285.2">94</a>.
</p>
<p>Similarly among the Ostyaks “members of the same tribe, whether large or small, consider
themselves as relations, even where the common ancestor is unknown, and where the
evidence of consanguinity is wholly wanting. Nevertheless, the feeling of consanguinity,
sometimes real, sometimes conventional, is the fundamental principle of the union.
The rich, of which there are few, help the poor, who are many. There is not much that
can change hands. The little, however, that is wanted by the needy is taken as a right
rather than a favour”<a class="noteRef" id="n285.3src" href="#n285.3">95</a>.
</p>
<p>The Altaians are very sensitive about their liberty. “Every poor man who joins a rich
family considers himself a member of it. He will perish of hunger, rather than comply
with a demand of his rich neighbour made in a commanding tone”<a class="noteRef" id="n285.4src" href="#n285.4">96</a>.
</p>
<p>Licata tells us that hungry Danakil go to their chief and say: “I am hungry, give
me something to eat”<a class="noteRef" id="n285.5src" href="#n285.5">97</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Larbas free labourers “work for one more fortunate than themselves, but
not for a superior; for notwithstanding the relation of employer and employed, equality
prevails”<a class="noteRef" id="n285.6src" href="#n285.6">98</a>.
</p>
<p>It is easy to understand that slaves are preferred to such servants. Only in one case
is this preference mentioned by an ethnographer. Munzinger states that the slaves
bought by the rich Beduan for household work are generally more trusted <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>than ordinary servants, as they are riveted to their position<a class="noteRef" id="n286.1src" href="#n286.1">99</a>. But we may safely suppose that in other cases also this circumstance has furthered
the growth of slavery.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We have explained why pastoral tribes have no great use for slave labour. We have
also mentioned some motives that may induce such tribes to keep slaves. But the fact
has not yet been accounted for, that some pastoral tribes keep slaves and others do
not. Whence this difference? It has been shown that slavery does not only exist among
pastoral tribes that till the soil to a limited extent. Among all pastoral tribes
subsistence is dependent on capital. Wealth, too, exists among all these tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n286.2src" href="#n286.2">100</a>; and we cannot see why slaves, as a luxury, would be wanted by one such tribe more
than by another. As slaves are sometimes employed as warriors, we might be inclined
to suppose that slavery exists among all warlike tribes, and among these only. But
there are several pastoral tribes which, though very warlike, do not keep slaves:
Kazak Kirghiz, Turkomans, Massai, and some pastoral nomads of South Africa.
</p>
<p>That the subjection of tribes as such in stead of individual slaves, of which we have
spoken in the last paragraph, cannot account for all cases in which slavery does not
exist, becomes evident, if we take into consideration that most of the pastoral tribes
of North-East Africa, which keep other tribes in subjection, practise slavery, whereas
in Central Asia and Siberia we find neither subjected tribes nor slaves.
</p>
<p>Therefore there must be other causes.
</p>
<p>In chapter II we have spoken of <i>external causes</i>: it may be that slaves would be of great use, and yet cannot be kept, because the
coercive power of the tribe is not strong enough. We have also seen that this coercive
power is most strongly developed where men have fixed habitations, live in rather
large groups and preserve food for the time of scarcity, and where there is a group
of somewhat homogeneous tribes maintaining, constant relations with each other. Pastoral
tribes are nomadic, <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>do not live together in very large groups, and do not want to preserve food, for they
have their supply of food always at hand. Yet the fact that several pastoral tribes
keep slaves proves that at least among these the coercive power is strong enough.
We shall try to find a cause peculiar to these tribes, that enables them to keep slaves.
Now it is remarkable that our positive cases are nearly all of them found in a few
definite parts of the globe: North-East Africa, the Caucasus, and Arabia; whereas
the pastoral nomads of Siberia, Central Asia, India, and South Africa, with one exception
(the Ovaherero), do not keep slaves. And the parts where slavery exists are exactly
those where the slave-trade has for a long time been carried on on a large scale.
Accordingly, the slaves these tribes keep are often purchased from slave-traders and
in several cases belong to inferior races.
</p>
<p>The slaves of the Aeneze Bedouins are Negroes<a class="noteRef" id="n287.1src" href="#n287.1">101</a>.
</p>
<p>The slaves kept by the Larbas are Negroes purchased from slave-trading caravans<a class="noteRef" id="n287.2src" href="#n287.2">102</a>.
</p>
<p>Although we find no description of slave-trade among the Circassians, slaves in the
Caucasus are exported on a large scale<a class="noteRef" id="n287.3src" href="#n287.3">103</a>.
</p>
<p>Most slaves found among the Somal and Danakil are articles of transit trade: they
are purchased from interior tribes and intended to be sold to Arabians. A Somali never
becomes the slave of a Somali, and prisoners of war are not enslaved<a class="noteRef" id="n287.4src" href="#n287.4">104</a>.
</p>
<p>Many Beduan make it their business to steal slaves, whom they sell in Massowah<a class="noteRef" id="n287.5src" href="#n287.5">105</a>.
</p>
<p>The slaves kept by the Beni Amer are either captured from enemies or purchased abroad;
a Beni Amer never loses his freedom. Slaves are not, however, often sold abroad<a class="noteRef" id="n287.6src" href="#n287.6">106</a>.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the pastoral tribes of Central Asia and Siberia live in secluded
parts, far from the centres of the slave-trade.
</p>
<p>The slave-trade greatly facilitates the keeping of slaves. Where slaves are brought
by slave-dealers from remote parts, it is much easier to keep them than where they
have to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>captured from enemies, <i>i.e.</i> from the neighbours; in the latter case the slaves are very likely to run away and
return to their native country; but a purchased slave transported from a great distance
cannot so easily return; if he succeeded in escaping, he would be instantly recaptured
by one of the foreign tribes whose countries he would have to traverse. Moreover,
some tribes may, by their intercourse with slave-traders, have become familiar with
the idea of slavery, and so the slave-trade may have suggested to them the keeping
of slaves for their own use.
</p>
<p>There is another circumstance, which may partially account for the existence of slavery
among some of these tribes: the slaves are often Negroes. And Negroes have always
and everywhere been enslaved; they seem to be more fit for slaves than most races
of mankind. Galton, speaking of the Damaras, says: “These savages court slavery. You
engage one of them as a servant, and you find that he considers himself your property,
and that you are, in fact, become the owner of a slave. They have no independence
about them, generally speaking, but follow a master as spaniels would. Their hero-worship
is directed to people who have wit and strength enough to ill-use them. Revenge is
a very transient passion in their character, it gives way to admiration of the oppressor.
The Damaras seem to me to love nothing; the only strong feelings they possess, which
are not utterly gross and sensual, are those of admiration and fear. They seem to
be made for slavery, and naturally fall into its ways”<a class="noteRef" id="n288.1src" href="#n288.1">107</a>. And Hutter, describing the Bali tribes of Cameroon, remarks that the Negro wants
to be ruled and patiently endures any amount of oppression<a class="noteRef" id="n288.2src" href="#n288.2">108</a>. Similar descriptions may undoubtedly be given of many other Negro tribes. Moreover
several slave-keeping nomadic tribes are Semites and Hamites, and therefore look upon
the Negroes as an inferior race. Now, where slaves are procured mainly for military
purposes (and we have seen that this is often the case with pastoral tribes), an absorption
of foreigners into the tribe would answer the purpose as well as, and perhaps better
than, slavery. But where the foreigners belong to inferior races, the members of the
tribe <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>are not likely to intermarry with them and look upon them as their equals; they remain
slaves, though they are not of great use as such. We must also take into consideration
that inferior races are not so much to be dreaded as superior peoples; the latter,
if individuals belonging to them were kept as slaves, might retaliate upon the slave-owners.
This may have been the reason why the Kazak Kirghiz who, in Levchine’s time, kidnapped
many Russians, always sold them abroad: it would not have been safe to keep them as
slaves. Accordingly, Pallas states that in his time they used to kidnap men on the
Russian frontiers towards the time when they were going to remove with their herds,
so that they could not be pursued<a class="noteRef" id="n289.1src" href="#n289.1">109</a>.
</p>
<p>In the second chapter of this Part we have remarked that the growth of slavery is
furthered by the existence of a group of more or less similar tribes, the slave-trade
being in such cases the means of spreading slavery over the group. We may say now
that, whether such a group exists or not, the slave-trade facilitates the keeping
of slaves. When the coercive power of a tribe is not strong enough for the keeping
of prisoners as slaves, the slave-trade may enable such a tribe to keep slaves; for
the keeping of purchased slaves, brought from a great distance, does not require so
much coercive power.
</p>
<p>We see that the difference between the slave-keeping and the other pastoral tribes
consists in external circumstances. Pastoral tribes have no strong motives for making
slaves, for the use of slave labour is small. On the other hand, there are no causes
absolutely preventing them from keeping slaves. These tribes are, so to speak, in
a state of equilibrium; a small additional cause on either side turns the balance.
One such additional cause is the slave-trade; another is the neighbourhood of inferior
races. There may be other small additional causes, peculiar to single tribes. We shall
not inquire whether there are, but content ourselves with the foregoing conclusions,
of which the principal are these, that the taming of animals does not naturally lead
to the taming of men, and that the relation between capital and labour among pastoral
tribes renders the economic use of slavery very small.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>Recapitulating, we may remark that our general theory, that there is no great use
for slave labour where subsistence depends on capital, is fully verified by our investigation
of economic life among pastoral tribes.
</p>
<p>Two secondary internal causes found in the second chapter have been also met with
among pastoral tribes: slaves are sometimes employed in warfare, and sometimes for
domestic labour to relieve the women of their task. Two new secondary factors have
been found in this chapter: slaves are kept as a luxury; and sometimes the subjection
of tribes as such, serving as a substitute for slavery, makes slavery proper superfluous.
</p>
<p>With regard to the external causes it has been shown that the coercive power of pastoral
tribes is not very strong, as they are nomadic and live in rather small groups; but
this want is sometimes compensated for by the slave-trade and the neighbourhood of
inferior races. The two latter circumstances may therefore rank as new external causes,
the slave-trade taking the place of the existence of a homogeneous group. On the Pacific
Coast of N. America it is the trade between tribes of the same culture, among pastoral
nomads it is the trade with Arabia, etc.; but in either case it is the slave-trade
that furthers the growth of slavery.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 2.</span> <i>Development of agriculture and development of slavery.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What do these numbers teach us?
</p>
<p>In the first place we see that many (170) agricultural tribes keep slaves. Hence it
appears that slavery is by no means <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>incompatible with agriculture. But there are also many (95) agricultural tribes without
slaves, so the existence of agriculture among savage tribes does not necessarily lead
to the keeping of slaves.
</p>
<p>In the second place it appears that the more agriculture is developed, the more frequent
slavery becomes. Looking at those agricultural tribes among which subsistence does
not depend to any considerable extent on cattle-breeding or trade (a<sup>1</sup>, a<sup>2</sup>, a<sup>3</sup>), we find that in the first group there are 26 positive and 37 negative cases, <i>i.e.</i> 41,3 per cent. of these tribes keep slaves. In the second group the corresponding
numbers are 66 positive cases, 43 negative cases, and 60,6 per cent.; in the third
group 10 positive cases, 1 negative case, and 90,9 per cent. We see that in the second
group slavery is more frequent than in the first, whereas in the third group it is
almost universal. It has, however, to be taken into consideration, that the great
majority (9 out of 10) of the slave-keeping tribes belonging to the third group live
in the Malay Archipelago, and 5 out of these 9 are divisions of the Battas. We may
not, therefore, attach much importance to the numbers relating to the third group;
for they may be strongly influenced <span class="corr" id="xd32e16901" title="Source: bij">by</span> local circumstances. Taking the second and third group together we find 76 positive
and 44 negative cases, <i>i.e.</i> 63,3 per cent. keep slaves, which percentage is considerably higher than that of
the first group.
</p>
<p>We do not claim mathematical exactness for these numbers. But at any rate we may say
that they sufficiently prove, that slavery is considerably more frequent among truly
agricultural tribes, which subsist chiefly by agriculture, than among incipient agriculturists,
who still depend on hunting or fishing for a large portion of their food.
</p>
<p>The total numbers lead to the same conclusion. Looking at these we find in the first
group 34 positive and 43 negative cases, <i>i.e.</i> 44,2 per cent. keep slaves. For the second group the corresponding numbers are 116
pos. cases, 48 neg. cases and 70,7 per cent; for the third group 20 pos. cases, 4
neg. cases and 83,3 per cent<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>; for the second and third group taken together 136 pos. cases, 52 neg. cases and
72,3 per cent.
</p>
<p>This agrees with what we expected. The tribes belonging to the first group, the “hunting
agriculturists” (<i lang="de">Jägerbauern</i>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>as Dargun calls them, bear a strong resemblance to hunting tribes. Generally the men’s
business is hunting and warfare, whereas the women have to till the soil. The division
of labour between the sexes does not much differ here from that which exists in Australia,
where the men hunt and the women gather fruits and dig roots. These tribes are also
often nomadic: when the fruits of their fields are scarcely ripe, they reap them and
remove to some other place<a class="noteRef" id="n295.1src" href="#n295.1">2</a>.
</p>
<p>The best specimens of this type are found in South America.
</p>
<p>Azara, speaking of the Indians living in and around Paraguay, remarks: “Even the agricultural
tribes are more or less nomadic. Wherever the Indians pass they sow something, and
later on return to reap the fruits”<a class="noteRef" id="n295.2src" href="#n295.2">3</a>.
</p>
<p>Lery, a writer of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, tells us that among the Tupinambas the principal cultures were two roots,
which he calls <i>aypi</i> and <i>maniot</i>. They were cultivated by the women. After being planted the roots needed no further
care, and within 2 or 3 months were fit to be dug up. Maize was also cultivated by
the women. The Tupinambas depended on hunting and fishing for a considerable portion
of their food. They did not generally remain for longer than 5 or 6 months in one
place, but were always removing from one place to another, carrying their house-building
materials with them<a class="noteRef" id="n295.3src" href="#n295.3">4</a>.
</p>
<p>Von den Steinen, describing the tribes on the Upper Schingu (in Brazil), states that,
though largely subsisting on agriculture, they are psychically hunters rather than
agriculturists. Like everywhere in Brazil, the women not only prepare the food, but
cultivate the manioc. The men cultivate nothing but tobacco, the smoking of which
is their exclusive privilege<a class="noteRef" id="n295.4src" href="#n295.4">5</a>.
</p>
<p>We have seen (in chap. II of this second Part) that hunters hardly ever keep slaves;
and as the “hunting agriculturists” so much resemble true hunters, it is easy to understand
why among the majority of them slavery does not exist. Slaves cannot be employed for
hunting, and the women can easily perform the small amount of cultivation wanted by
these tribes. <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>Moreover, the men who, as warriors, are able to procure slaves, are not likely to
take them for the sole benefit of the women. And where the men are always hunting,
the women would have to supervise the slaves and keep them in order, which is not
easy for them.
</p>
<p>That this lowest stage of agriculture is not favourable to the growth of slavery,
is confirmed by what Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Kruyt had the kindness to write us regarding Central
Celebes. There is one native tribe, the Topebato, that formerly did not keep slaves,
the probable cause being that they had remained hunters longer than the other tribes
in the neighbourhood. In a legend, in which it is told that the gods made gifts to
the different tribes characterizing their manner of life, the Topebato get a dog allotted
to them for the chase, and though now they till the soil, they are still passionate
hunters. They now buy a few slaves and so in the course of time a slave class will
originate among them.
</p>
<p>Yet there are a considerable number of positive cases in our first group (26 out of
63). We will, of course, make due allowance for mistakes; there may be several tribes
contained in our first group which on closer scrutiny would prove to be true agriculturists
and not <i lang="de">Jägerbauern</i>. But we cannot think but that among these 26 tribes there are many, which have been
justly placed in the first group. The existence of slavery among them will have to
be accounted for by secondary causes, internal and external, such as we have found
in the foregoing chapters and of which we shall perhaps find some more in the continuation
of this chapter.
</p>
<p>We must, however, bear in mind that our first group does not only contain “hunting”,
but also “fishing agriculturists”; and we know that fishers are more likely to keep
slaves than hunters. This may perhaps account for the existence of slavery among some
of these tribes. But our numbers give us no hint in this direction. We find, indeed,
that 11 out of 26 positive cases are afforded by tribes inhabiting the islands of
the Malay Archipelago; but among these there are some Dyak tribes living in the interior
of Borneo. Moreover, South America affords 6 positive, and the Melanesian islands
12 negative cases. We may suppose that whatever effect this factor has is neutralized
by the intervention of other circumstances.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 3.</span> <i>Capital and labour among agricultural tribes.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have seen that among the purely agricultural tribes of the second and third stages
there are altogether 76 positive and 44 negative cases, <i>i.e.</i> more than three-fifths of them keep slaves. These numbers make it probable, that
the existence of slavery among agricultural tribes has to be accounted for by general
causes, that agricultural life as such is favourable to the growth of slavery. We
have to inquire now, whether this supposition is justified by an application of the
general principle laid down in § 6 of the second chapter, <i>i.e.</i> whether among agricultural tribes subsistence is dependent on capital, and if not,
whether it is easy or difficult to procure.
</p>
<p>It appears that, where agriculture is carried on without the aid of domestic animals,
subsistence does not depend on capital. The savage agriculturist is unacquainted with
the more perfect and costly agricultural implements used in Europe, and, where population
is scarce (as it is among most savages) cultivates only such grounds as are most fertile
and easiest of access. Even the plough is used by very few savages; they most often
content themselves with a pointed stick or hoe, wherefore Hahn calls the agriculture
carried on by them hoe-culture (<i lang="de">Hackbau</i>), as distinguished from agriculture proper (<i lang="de">Ackerbau</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n297.1src" href="#n297.1">6</a>. And even where agriculture is carried on in a more skilful manner, <i>e.g.</i> by means of irrigation, it is not capital that is wanted, but labour. The construction
of the irrigation-works may be a long and laborious task, but the materials cost nothing.
There is only one instance in which we have found it stated that agriculture cannot
well be carried on without capital. Radloff tells us that the Kazak Kirghiz, besides
rearing cattle, are largely agricultural. Some fields want constant irrigation, and
the water is very difficult to procure. The rich use a paddle-wheel; the poor bring
the water to their fields in buckets and wooden vessels, but this is of little avail.
Therefore it is only the rich who are capable of carrying on agriculture to any considerable
extent<a class="noteRef" id="n297.2src" href="#n297.2">7</a>. But this state of things probably had not yet existed more than some 30 years; for
<span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>Levchine (writing about 30 years earlier than Radloff) states that in his time agriculture
was of little importance; and he does not make any mention of irrigation<a class="noteRef" id="n298.1src" href="#n298.1">8</a>. The introduction of the paddle wheel has therefore probably to be ascribed to the
Russians; for the Kazak Kirghiz, in Radloff’s time, were already strongly influenced
by them; so we may not speak here of a fact belonging to savage life. We have not
found any other instance of this dependence of agriculture on capital; but even if
there be a few instances, we are justified in concluding that, generally speaking,
the savage agriculturist can perfectly well do without capital, except, of course,
where he depends on cattle.
</p>
<p>Moreover, subsistence is fairly easy to procure. Agriculture, where it is carried
on in such simple manner as among most savages, does not require much skill or application.
As compared with hunting, seafaring and manufactures, it is rather dull work, requiring
patience rather than strength or skill. It is one of the occupations about which there
is no excitement, and which in many primitive societies are performed by the women.
Hunting requires personal qualities, and a good hunter is held in high esteem; but
we have not found it stated in a single instance, that a man’s influence or power
depends on his ability in agriculture.
</p>
<p>Subsistence, therefore, is independent of capital and easy to procure. Every one is
able to clear a piece of ground and provide for himself; nobody offers his services
to another, and so, if a man wants a labourer, he must compel his fellow-man to work
for him. “All freemen in new countries” says Bagehot “must be pretty equal; every
one has labour, and every one has land; capital, at least in agricultural countries
(for pastoral countries are very different), is of little use; it cannot hire labour;
the labourers go and work for themselves. There is a story often told of a great English
capitalist who went out to Australia with a shipload of labourers and a carriage;
his plan was that the labourers should build a house for him, and that he would keep
his carriage, just as in England. But (so the story goes) he had to try to live in
his carriage, for <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>his labourers left him, and went away to work for themselves”<a class="noteRef" id="n299.1src" href="#n299.1">9</a>. Similarly, Sombart observes: “Colonies, in which there are no labourers to exploit,
are like knives without blades”<a class="noteRef" id="n299.2src" href="#n299.2">10</a>. In such countries, if a man wants others to work in his service and according to
his instructions, he must compel them to do so, <i>i.e.</i> he must enslave them. And agriculture, requiring little skill and application, is
very fit to be imposed upon slaves: compulsory agricultural labour, though not so
productive as voluntary labour, can yet yield some profit. Moreover, the agricultural
slave is rather easy to control; his work does not require independent action. It
is also easy to prevent him from running away. In all this he differs from a hunting
slave. And agriculture is also more favourable to the existence of slavery than cattle-breeding;
for among pastoral tribes there is but a fixed and rather small amount of work to
be done; but where men subsist by agriculture, any increase in the number of slaves
brings about an increase of food.
</p>
<p>We cannot, therefore, agree with Adam Smith, who asserts that in those countries where
slaves are employed, it would be more profitable to employ free labourers, and that
it was, in general, pride and love of power in the master that led to the employment
of slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n299.3src" href="#n299.3">11</a>. A free labourer, it is true, is more interested in the work he has to do, and therefore
likely to do it better, than a slave; but in those countries where there is an abundance
of fertile soil, and capital is of little use, free labourers cannot be had; every
freeman prefers working for himself, or perhaps not working at all.
</p>
<p>Cairnes, speaking of Negro slavery as it was carried on in the United States, admits
that slave labour has sometimes an advantage over free labour, but only where tobacco,
cotton and similar crops are raised for industrial purposes, not where cereals are
grown. “The economic advantages of slavery” he remarks “are easily stated: they are
all comprised in the fact that the employer of slaves has absolute power over his
workmen, <span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>and enjoys the disposal of the whole fruit of their labours. Slave labour, therefore,
admits of the most complete organization; that is to say, it may be combined on an
extensive scale, and directed by a controlling mind to a single end, and its cost
can never rise above that which is necessary to maintain the slave in health and strength.
On the other hand, the economical defects of slave labour are very serious. They may
be summed up under the three following heads:—it is given reluctantly; it is unskilful;
it is wanting in versatility.… The line dividing the Slave from the Free States marks
also an important division in the agricultural capabilities of North America. North
of this line, the products for which the soil and climate are best adapted are cereal
crops, while south of it the prevailing crops are tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar;
and these two classes of crops are broadly distinguished in the methods of culture
suitable to each. The cultivation of the one class, of which cotton may be taken as
the type, requires for its efficient conduct that labour should be combined and organized
on an extensive scale. On the other hand, for the raising of cereal crops this condition
is not so essential. Even where labour is abundant and that labour free, the large
capitalist does not in this mode of farming appear on the whole to have any preponderating
advantage over the small proprietor, who, with his family, cultivates his own farm,
as the example of the best cultivated states in Europe proves. Whatever superiority
he may have in the power of combining and directing labour seems to be compensated
by the greater energy and spirit which the sense of property gives to the exertions
of the small proprietor. But there is another essential circumstance in which these
two classes of crops differ. A single labourer, Mr. Russell tells us, can cultivate
twenty acres of wheat or Indian corn, while he cannot manage more than two of tobacco,
or three of cotton. It appears from this that tobacco and cotton fulfil that condition
which we saw was essential to the economical employment of slaves—the possibility
of working large numbers within a limited space; while wheat and Indian corn, in the
cultivation of which the labourers are dispersed over a wide surface, fail in this
respect. We thus find that cotton, and the class of crops of which <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>cotton may be taken as the type, favour the employment of slaves in competition with
peasant proprietors in two leading ways: first, they need extensive combination and
organization of labour—requirements which slavery is eminently calculated to supply,
but in respect to which the labour of peasant proprietors is defective; and secondly,
they allow of labour being concentrated, and thus minimize the cardinal evil of slave
labour—the reluctance with which it is yielded. On the other hand, the cultivation
of cereal crops, in which extensive combination of labour is not important, and in
which the operations of industry are widely diffused, offers none of these advantages
for the employment of slaves, while it is remarkably fitted to bring out in the highest
degree the especial excellencies of the industry of free proprietors. Owing to these
causes it has happened that slavery has been maintained in the Southern States<a class="noteRef" id="n301.1src" href="#n301.1">12</a>, which favour the growth of tobacco, cotton, and analogous products, while, in the
Northern States, of which cereal crops are the great staple, it from an early period
declined and has ultimately died out. And, in confirmation of this view, it may be
added that wherever in the Southern States the external conditions are especially
favourable to cereal crops, as in parts of Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and along
the slopes of the Alleghanies, there slavery has always failed to maintain itself.
It is owing to this cause that there now exists in some parts of the South a considerable
element of free labouring population”<a class="noteRef" id="n301.2src" href="#n301.2">13</a>.
</p>
<p>This reasoning is quite correct so far as Negro slavery in the United States is concerned;
but it does not hold with regard to primitive slavery or “retail slavery” as Bagehot
calls it. The few slaves kept in primitive agricultural societies work together with
their masters, who can therefore continually supervise their work and do not want
overseers. Moreover, the slave in primitive and simple societies is not looked upon
as a piece of machinery; he is, so to speak, an inferior member of the family, sharing
in its pleasures, sorrows, and occupations; therefore it is not only the fear of punishment
that induces him to work; he is interested in the welfare of the family, and knows
<span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>that the better he works, the more he will be valued, and the more food there will
be of which he will get his due share<a class="noteRef" id="n302.1src" href="#n302.1">14</a>. This retail slavery, as Bagehot remarks, “the slavery in which a master owns a few
slaves, whom he well knows and daily sees—is not at all an intolerable state; the
slaves of Abraham had no doubt a fair life, as things went in that day. But wholesale
slavery, where men are but one of the investments of large capital, and where a great
owner, so far from knowing each slave, can hardly tell how many gangs of them he works,
is an abominable state”<a class="noteRef" id="n302.2src" href="#n302.2">15</a>. Retail slavery, therefore, can very well exist where cereal crops are raised; it
is even the most convenient system of labour in primitive agricultural societies.
</p>
<p>We see that the general economic state of truly agricultural tribes may account for
the existence of slavery among so many of these tribes. We shall now inquire what
secondary causes there are at work among agricultural tribes, and what effect they
have. But we shall have to speak first of a great factor in economic life, which we
have not met with before.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 4.</span> <i>Land and population.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general principle laid down in the last paragraph is that in primitive agricultural
societies capital is of little use and subsistence easy to acquire; therefore every
able-bodied man can, by taking a piece of land into cultivation, provide for himself.
Hence it follows that nobody voluntarily serves another; he who wants a labourer must
subject him, and this subjection will often assume the character of slavery.
</p>
<p>But this general rule requires an important qualification. Hitherto we have supposed,
that there is much more fertile land than is required to be cultivated for the support
of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>actual population. Such, indeed, is the case among most savages; but it is not always
so. And where it is not so, our general rule does not obtain. When all land fit for
cultivation has been appropriated, a man, though able-bodied and willing to work,
if he owns no land, cannot earn his subsistence independently of a landlord; he has
to apply to the owners of the land for employment as a tenant or servant. In such
case free labourers are available; therefore slaves are not wanted.
</p>
<p>In this and the ensuing paragraphs we shall endeavour to prove by facts the hypothesis
arrived at here by a deductive reasoning, which we may express thus: <i>where all land fit for cultivation has been appropriated, slavery is not likely to
exist</i>.
</p>
<p>The same <span class="corr" id="xd32e17068" title="Source: vieuw">view</span> is held by some theoretical writers.
</p>
<p>According to Cairnes “slavery, as a permanent system, has need not merely of a fertile
soil, but of a practically unlimited extent of it. This arises from the defect of
slave labour in point of versatility. As has been already remarked, the difficulty
of teaching the slave anything is so great—the result of the compulsory ignorance
in which he is kept, combined with want of intelligent interest in his work—that the
only chance of rendering his labour profitable is, when he has once learned a lesson,
to keep him to that lesson for life. Accordingly where agricultural operations are
carried on by slaves, the business of each gang is always restricted to the raising
of a single product.… Whatever crop may be best suited to the character of the soil
and the nature of slave industry, whether cotton, tobacco, sugar, or rice, that crop
is cultivated, and that alone. Rotation of crops is thus precluded by the conditions
of the case. The soil is tasked again and again to yield the same product, and the
inevitable result follows. After a short series of years its fertility is completely
exhausted, the planter—“land-killer” he is called in the picturesque nomenclature
of the South—abandons the ground which he has rendered worthless, and passes on to
seek in new soils for that fertility under which alone the agencies at his disposal
can be profitably employed.… Slave cultivation, wherever it has been tried in the
new world, has issued in the same results. Precluding the conditions of rotation of
crops or skilful management, it tends inevitably to exhaust the land of a country
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>consequently requires for its permanent success not merely a fertile soil but a practically
unlimited extent of it.” Therefore expansion is a necessity of slave societies<a class="noteRef" id="n304.1src" href="#n304.1">16</a>.
</p>
<p>In the same sense Weber, speaking of the ancient states of Asia and Europe, remarks
that slavery is uneconomical, where a dense population and high prices of the land
render an intensive cultivation necessary<a class="noteRef" id="n304.2src" href="#n304.2">17</a>.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see that these arguments do not apply to slavery as practised by savages.
Rotation of crops and skilful management are wanting among most savage tribes, whether
they keep slaves or not. Moreover, as we have already remarked, the slaves kept by
them are not pieces of machinery, nor, as in the United States, kept in compulsory
ignorance; they are rather regarded as members of the master’s family; there is no
great difference between master and slave<a class="noteRef" id="n304.3src" href="#n304.3">18</a>. We may therefore suppose that, whether a savage tribe keeps slaves or not, agriculture
is carried on in the same manner.
</p>
<p>Loria also holds that slavery requires an abundant supply of ground; but his arguments
are quite different from Cairnes’. His reasoning is as follows.
</p>
<p>As long as there is land not yet appropriated, which a man destitute of capital can
take into cultivation, capitalistic property cannot exist; for nobody is inclined
to work for a capitalist, when he can work for his own profit on land that costs him
nothing. If, then, the capitalist wants by any means to get a profit, he must violently
suppress the free land to which the labourer owes his force and liberty. And as long
as the population is scarce and therefore all land cannot possibly be appropriated,
the only means of suppressing the free land is by subjugating the labourer. This subjugation
assumes at first the form of slavery; afterwards, when the decreasing fertility of
the soil has to be made up for by a greater fertility of labour, slavery gives place
to serfdom, which is milder and makes labour more productive.
</p>
<p>When the population increases, and all land that can be cultivated <span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>by labour without the aid of capital had been appropriated, quite another state of
things prevails. The labourer has now no other resource but to sell his labour to
the capitalist for such wages as the latter likes to give; he is compelled to yield
to the capitalist the greater part of the produce of his labour. Now the latter need
no longer use violence to get his profit; for it falls to him by the automatic operation
of the social system. Yet, even then the capitalistic <i>régime</i> is not absolutely certain to arise, for there is still land not yet appropriated,
that can be cultivated with the aid of capital. If, therefore, the labourers could
save a portion of their earnings and thus accumulate capital, they would be able to
take this land into cultivation and so make themselves independent of their employers.
This consideration induces the capitalist to keep wages so low that they cannot exceed
the immediate wants of the labourers, which he brings about by various artificial
means.
</p>
<p>When, finally, a further increase of population makes the total appropriation of the
land possible, the mere appropriation of it by the capitalist class renders the labourers
for ever subjected. The capitalist need no longer have recourse to artificial methods
of reducing wages; the system operates automatically. The capitalists have only to
retain the land for themselves; they will then secure a perpetual revenue at the cost
of the labouring class.
</p>
<p>“The basis of capitalistic property is thus always the same, viz. the suppression
of the free land, the exclusion of the labourer from the appropriation of the land.
This is brought about by various means, according to the fertility of the land and
the extent to which it has already been appropriated. As long as there is free land
fit for cultivation by labour without the aid of capital, the only means of suppressing
it are slavery and serfdom; afterwards, when the land not yet appropriated can only
be cultivated by one who owns capital, it is sufficient systematically to reduce wages
to a level that does not enable the labourers to save; when, finally, the population
has so far increased as to make the appropriation of all land possible, the capitalists
have only to keep the land to themselves”<a class="noteRef" id="n305.1src" href="#n305.1">19</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many objections can be made to Loria’s arguments. He is constantly confusing capitalist
and landlord. He seems to consider capitalists and labourers as two strictly separated
classes, though we see continually people passing from one class to the other. And
when he tells us that, if wages were higher, the labourers would save a portion of
their earnings and so accumulate capital, but that the employers, wishing to prevent
this, keep wages low,—he ascribes to both capitalists and labourers so much forethought
and consciousness of class-interest as men scarcely ever have, except in books on
political economy<a class="noteRef" id="n306.1src" href="#n306.1">20</a>. Yet we cannot think but that in the main Loria is right. The gist of his reasoning
is what we have already remarked in the beginning of this paragraph. As long as there
is an abundance of land not yet appropriated, and therefore at the disposal of whoever
may choose to cultivate it, nobody applies to another for employment, and the only
labourers a man can procure are forced labourers. But when all land has been appropriated,
those who own no land are at the mercy of the landholders, and voluntarily serve them;
therefore slaves are not wanted.
</p>
<p>Much more fully has the true reason, why in densely peopled countries there is little
use for slaves, been recognized by Wakefield in his book on the art of colonization.
With him, the theory is not based upon a general conception of society, but upon the
facts of the colonial history of his own time.
</p>
<p>Wakefield, then, complains that in Australia and other colonies manufactures cannot
thrive; the reason for this is, according to him, that there are no labourers to be
had; for there is so much free land that every newly-arrived labourer becomes a landowner
rather than work for wages. Therefore there are many colonies which would keep slaves
if the home government let them. This leads the writer to an investigation of the
circumstances which induce men to keep slaves.
</p>
<p>“They are not moral, but economical circumstances; they relate not to vice and virtue,
but to production. They are the circumstances, in which one man finds it difficult
or impossible <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>to get other men to work under his direction for wages. They are the circumstances
… which stand in the way of combination and constancy of labour, and which all civilized
nations, in a certain stage of their advance from barbarism, have endeavoured to counteract,
and have in some measure counteracted, by means of some kind of slavery. Hitherto
in this world, labour has never been employed on any considerable scale, with constancy
and in combination, except by one or other of two means; either by hiring, or by slavery
of some kind. What the principle of association may do in the production of wealth,
and for the labouring classes, without either slavery or hiring, remains to be seen;
but at present we cannot rely upon it.…
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd32e17133" title="Not in source">“</span>Slavery is evidently a make-shift for hiring; a proceeding to which recourse is had,
only when hiring is impossible or difficult … it is adopted because at the time and
under the circumstances there is no other way of getting labourers to work with constancy
and in combination. What, then, are the circumstances under which this happens?
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd32e17136" title="Not in source">“</span>It happens whenever population is scanty in proportion to land. Slavery … has been
confined to countries of a scanty population, has never existed in very populous countries,
and has gradually ceased in the countries whose population gradually increased to
the point of density. And the reason is plain enough.… In populous countries, the
desire to own land is not easily gratified, because the land is scarce and dear: the
plentifulness and cheapness of land in thinly-peopled countries enables almost everybody
who wishes it to become a landowner. In thinly-peopled countries, accordingly, the
great majority of free people are landowners who cultivate their own land; and labour
for hire is necessarily scarce: in densely-peopled countries, on the contrary, the
great majority of the people cannot obtain land, and there is plenty of labour for
hire. Of plentifulness of labour for hire, the cause is dearness of land: cheapness
of land is the cause of scarcity of labour for hire”<a class="noteRef" id="n307.1src" href="#n307.1">21</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>Wakefield proposed that the government should sell the new land in the colonies at
a sufficient price, <i>i.e.</i> at a price which would oblige the newly arrived labourers to serve a few years for
wages before being able to become landowners<a class="noteRef" id="n308.1src" href="#n308.1">22</a>.
</p>
<p>Another writer on colonial matters of the same period, Merivale, follows quite the
same line of argument as Wakefield. The great demand for slaves and the great profitableness
of slavery, he says, arise altogether from the scarcity of labour. “When the pressure
of population induces the freeman to offer his services, as he does in all old countries,
for little more than the natural minimum of wages, those services are very certain
to be more productive and less expensive than those of the bondsman, whose support
is a charge to the master, and who has nothing to gain by his industry.… This being
the case, it is obvious that the limit of the profitable duration of slavery is attained
whenever the population has become so dense that it is cheaper to employ the free
labourer for hire. Towards this limit every community is approximating, however slowly.”
That the relation between land and population is indeed the determining factor as
regards the system of labour most suitable to a country, is clearly shown by the effect
which the emancipation of the slaves had upon the economic development of the different
colonies. Merivale then proceeds to divide the British slave colonies, at the time
of emancipation, into three classes, as respects their economical situation. First,
the oldest settlements, established in the smaller Antilles (Barbadoes, Antigua, etc.).
They were those in which the land was nearly all occupied. “They were less injured
than any others by the immediate effect of emancipation; for the negroes had no resource
except in continuing to work; there was no unoccupied land for them to possess, no
independent mode of obtaining a subsistence to which they could resort, still less
of obtaining those luxuries which habit had rendered desirable to them.” “The next
class is that of colonies in which the fertile or advantageously situated soil was
all cultivated, and becoming <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>exhausted; but there remained much unoccupied soil, of a less valuable description,
and the population was not dense in proportion to the whole surface.” This applies
especially to Jamaica. Here the colonists “were injured, <i>perhaps</i>, by the abolition of the slave trade; and they suffer now, since emancipation, by
the difficulty of compelling the negroes to perform hired labour while they have their
own provision grounds, and other resources, at their disposal.” “Finally, there is
a third class of colonies, in some of which the fertility of the cultivated soil is
as yet unexhausted, in others there is abundance of fertile and unoccupied land. Such
are the Mauritius and Trinidad, and, in a far higher degree, Guiana”. In these colonies,
after emancipation, “the negroes have found it easy to obtain a subsistence in a country
overflowing with natural wealth: they have been rescued from a servitude involving,
perhaps, a greater amount of labour than in any other settlements: they have abundance
of land to resort to for their maintenance. The accounts, both from Guiana and Trinidad,
seem to report the negroes as generally peaceful and well-inclined, but indisposed
to labour, to which they can only be tempted by the most exorbitant offers of wages”<a class="noteRef" id="n309.1src" href="#n309.1">23</a>.
</p>
<p>There is one more reason why slaves are of little use in those countries where all
land has been appropriated. When there is free land, a man can, by increasing the
number of his slaves, to any extent augment his revenue: every slave will take a new
patch of land into cultivation; the more slaves a man owns, the more land he will
have in tillage. But when the supply of land is limited, each landowner can employ
only a definite number of labourers. As soon as there are hands enough to cultivate
his grounds, an increase in the number of labourers soon becomes unprofitable. What
we have said of pastoral tribes obtains here too: it may be that slaves are wanted,
but when they are procured the point will soon be reached at which a further increase
in their number yields no longer any profit. Therefore, when all land has been appropriated,
even though it be equally divided between the members of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>community and so a labouring class be wanting, there is little use for slaves.
</p>
<p>It must be understood that we speak here of self-dependent agricultural countries.
Where manufactures and the trade with foreign parts are highly developed, economic
life becomes much more complicated and presents quite another character.
</p>
<p>What we want to prove is that in such self-dependent agricultural countries, when
all arable land has been appropriated, slavery is not likely to exist.
</p>
<p>All land has been appropriated, when every piece of land is claimed by some one as
his property. The owner, of course, need not be an individual; land may also be owned
by a group of individuals. Yet the statements of our ethnographers concerning tribal
property may not be accepted without much caution. They often tell us that a tribe
claims the ownership of the territory it inhabits. This so-called right of property
held by the tribe often proves to consist in this, that no strangers are admitted
to the territory, but every member of the tribe may cultivate as much of the land
as he likes. In such case, whether it be the tribe or the king to whom the land is
stated to belong, the term “ownership” is very inappropriately used<a class="noteRef" id="n310.1src" href="#n310.1">24</a>. We shall only speak of appropriation of land when some one claims the use of it
to the exclusion of all others, and values his property. Where the so-called owner
is always willing to give a piece of it in cultivation to whoever wants to cultivate
it, we shall not speak of appropriation; where, however, the land is never (except
by way of favour) given in use <i>gratis</i>, but a rent is always stipulated, it appears that the owner values it, it has now
really been appropriated<a class="noteRef" id="n310.2src" href="#n310.2">25</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is not always clearly stated whether all land has been appropriated. Then we shall
have recourse to some criteria from which we may infer whether such be the case.
</p>
<p>The principal criterion is the existence of a class of freemen destitute of land<a class="noteRef" id="n311.1src" href="#n311.1">26</a>. Where such people are found we may be sure that there is no free land; else they
would be able to take it into cultivation. It need scarcely be added that even where
no such people are found, it may be that all land has been appropriated, everybody
sharing in it.
</p>
<p>The appropriation of the land does not imply that all land is actually being cultivated.
There may be land actually out of tillage and yet valued by the owner. But when it
is stated that all land is being cultivated, it must all have been appropriated. This
will therefore be our second criterion.
</p>
<p>There is another criterion that proves that all land has not yet been appropriated.
When we are told that clearing a piece of land is a <i lang="la">modus acquirendi</i> of landed property, there must still be free land.
</p>
<p>The appropriation of all land implies that property in land exists; but the reverse
is not true: when we are informed that property in land exists, this does not prove
that all land has already been appropriated. For as soon as the population has so
far increased as to require the cultivation of land less fertile than that which was
at first exclusively cultivated, the more fertile land acquires value. “On the first
settling of a country” says Ricardo “in which there is an abundance of rich and fertile
land, a very small proportion of which is required to be cultivated for the support
of the actual population, or indeed can be cultivated with the capital which the population
can command, there will be no rent; for no one would pay for the use of land, when
there was an abundant quantity not yet appropriated, and, therefore, at the disposal
of whosoever might choose to cultivate it.” But “when in the progress <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>of society, land of the second degree of fertility is taken into cultivation, rent
immediately commences on that of the first quality, and the amount of that rent will
depend on the difference in the quality of these two portions of land”<a class="noteRef" id="n312.1src" href="#n312.1">27</a>. As soon as land of the second degree of fertility is cultivated, rent commences;
but in such cases there is possibly much land of the second degree not yet appropriated,
and at any rate land of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, etc. degrees. Accordingly we find that among some savage tribes, where there is
an abundance of free land, some very fertile or very favourably situated pieces of
land are highly valued. We shall give one instance. Among the Sea Dyaks land is so
abundant that, if a Dyak, when about to cultivate a piece of land, finds a dead animal
lying on it, which he considers a bad omen, he immediately leaves the land, and seeks
a new field. Yet among the same Sea Dyaks “parents and children, brothers and sisters,
very seldom quarrel; when they do so, it is from having married into a family with
whom afterwards they may have disputes about land. One would imagine that was a subject
not likely to create dissensions in a country like Borneo; but there are favourite
farming-grounds, and boundaries are not very settled. It used to be the practice not
to have recourse to arms on those occasions, but the two parties collecting their
relatives and friends, would fight with sticks for the coveted spot”<a class="noteRef" id="n312.2src" href="#n312.2">28</a>. The last sentence proves that these quarrels were rather frequent. When, therefore,
it is stated that land has value, or that lands are rented, or that the wealth of
individuals consists partly in landed property, this does not prove that all land
has already been appropriated.
</p>
<p>We have spoken of all land fit for cultivation being appropriated. What land is fit
for cultivation in each country depends on the ability of the inhabitants in agriculture.
Much will also depend on the character of the individuals. Where these are vigorous
and enterprising, the people destitute of arable land will endure many hardships in
taking new lands into cultivation, whereas weak and indolent men will prefer being
employed by the rich. A good instance of this is furnished by the Bontoc <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>Igorot of Northern Luzon. Landed property here is highly developed. “It is largely
by the possession or nonpossession of real property that a man is considered rich
or poor.” “Irrigated rice lands are commonly leased.” “Unirrigated mountain camote
lands are rented outright.” Yet there is still unoccupied land. “Public lands and
forests extend in an irregular strip around most pueblos.… Public forests surround
the outlying private forests. They are usually from three to six hours distant. From
them any man gathers what he pleases, but until the American came to Bontoc the Igorot
seldom went that far for wood or lumber, as it was unsafe.” There are, however, people
who do not own land enough to live upon. “It is claimed that each household owns its
dwelling and at least two sementeras and one granary, though a man with no more property
than this is a poor man and some one in his family must work much of the time for
wages, because two average sementeras will not furnish all the rice needed by a family
for food”<a class="noteRef" id="n313.1src" href="#n313.1">29</a>. So the poor work for wages rather than going to settle on the outlying public lands,
to which they have free access. Here again we see that economic phenomena have always
a psychological basis<a class="noteRef" id="n313.2src" href="#n313.2">30</a>.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We shall not, in order to prove our hypothesis, examine the regulations of landed
property among all agricultural savage tribes, but confine ourselves to one geographical
group, in which the phenomena we have spoken of in this paragraph most strikingly
present themselves. This group is Oceania, comprehending Polynesia, Micronesia, and
Melanesia. We shall, however, leave out of regard New Guinea, one of the largest <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>islands of the world. The rest of Oceania consists chiefly of small islands.
</p>
<p>Slavery in Oceania (with the exception of New Guinea) has never prevailed to any great
extent. In the second chapter of Part I it has been shown that slavery, so far as
we can know, existed only in the N.&nbsp;W. Solomon Islands, on the Gazelle Peninsula of
Neu Pommern, and in New Zealand.
</p>
<p>We shall try to account for this fact by showing that on most of the Oceanic islands
all land had been appropriated, which led to a state of things inconsistent with slavery
as a social system.
</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs we shall inquire what our ethnographers have to say about
landed property in Oceania and the extent to which the land had been appropriated.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this and the following two paragraphs we shall not mention all particulars of land
tenure given by the ethnographers, but only those which may enable us to decide whether
all land had been appropriated.
</p>
<p>Mahler, speaking of Polynesia and Micronesia generally, remarks that on many islands
the burial-places occupied large tracts of land; but this does not prove that there
was abundance of land, for these places were hardly ever anything but (according to
Penny), “barren points where the wind howls and the sea moans, or rocky caverns in
which the waves dash with sullen roar”<a class="noteRef" id="n314.1src" href="#n314.1">31</a>.
</p>
<p>Waltershausen tells us that in Polynesia the cultivated land belonged to the king
and nobility, to the exclusion of the labouring classes. The upper classes also owned
the fruit-trees, the small coral islets surrounding the larger islands, the lakes,
the rivers, and those parts of the sea which extended from the land to the reefs.
The untilled land was the property of the tribe and, unless the king forbade it, every
one might cut the <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>wood growing on it for building houses and canoes; but only the ruling classes might
take it into cultivation<a class="noteRef" id="n315.1src" href="#n315.1">32</a>.
</p>
<p>Mariner states that in Tonga property principally consists in plantations, canoes
and houses. The plantations are owned by the chiefs and the nobles. Agricultural labourers
are very much despised; they serve the chiefs on whom they are dependent. West tells
us that “the feudal principle, that the whole country belonged exclusively to the
king, regulated the disposal and tenure of lands,” and so the lower classes were in
a slavelike condition. “Lands were held in fief. The great landlords derived them
by hereditary right, in conjunction with their chieftainship, but held them at the
will of the supreme ruler.” These landlords distributed their lands among their relations
and followers<a class="noteRef" id="n315.2src" href="#n315.2">33</a>.
</p>
<p>In Niué or Savage Island, “the land belongs to clans represented by their heads”.
“At present there is land enough for all, and the junior members of the clan come
to the headman whenever they want land to plant upon. Titles can be acquired by cultivation”<a class="noteRef" id="n315.3src" href="#n315.3">34</a>.
</p>
<p>“The land in Samoa” says Turner “is owned alike by the chiefs and these heads of families.
The land belonging to each family is well known, and the person who, for the time
being holds the title of the family head, has the right to dispose of it. It is the
same with the chiefs. There are certain tracts of bush or forest land which belong
to them. The uncultivated bush is sometimes claimed by those who own the land on its
borders. The lagoon also, as far as the reef, is considered the property of those
off whose village it is situated.” Von Bülow concludes from the legends and traditions
of the Samoans that formerly all the land belonged to the chiefs. But now the land
is owned by the families<a class="noteRef" id="n315.4src" href="#n315.4">35</a>.
</p>
<p>Gardiner gives an elaborate account of the regulation of landed property in Rotuma:
“No private property in land formerly existed, it was all vested in the <i>pure</i> for the time <span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>being of the <i>hoag</i><a class="noteRef" id="n316.1src" href="#n316.1">36</a>; the district generally had rights over it. It usually consisted of four kinds: bush,
swamp, coast, and proprietary water in the boat channel; common to the <i>hoag</i>, too, were wells and graveyards. Every member of the <i>hoag</i> knew its boundaries, which consisted of lines between certain trees or prominent
rocks, posts, and even stone walls. In the bush land every <i>hoag</i> possessed property; it lay on the slopes of hills and in valleys between at some
slight distance from the coast, from which it was separated by a stone wall, running
round the whole island. On it taro, yams, bananas, plantains, and a few cocoanut trees
were grown for food, while the paths into it and through it were planted with the
Tahitian chestnut, the fava tree, and the sagopalm. The Tahitian chestnut and fava
trees were favourite boundary marks owing to their size and longevity. Swamp land
is only possessed by Noatau, Oinafa, Matusa, and Itomotu. It is low-lying land, on
extensive beach sand flats, which exist in these districts. The tide always keeps
it wet, percolating through the sand, and in it is grown the <i>papoi</i>, or <i>broka</i>, against famine. The possession of a good-sized strip always caused and gave to the
<i>hoag</i> a position of importance; its boundaries were stones at the sides. Coast land lay
outside the surrounding wall, to which the <i>hoag</i> had a strip from and including the foreshore. On it as near as possible to the coast
the house or houses of the <i>hoag</i> were placed, while the rest of the land was planted with cocoanuts for drinking purposes.
Hifo trees are stated to have been planted formerly to show the boundaries, but they
more often now consist of stones or cocoanut trees, the ownership of which is a constant
source of dispute. Districts and even villages were sharply marked off by walls down
to the beach. All had the right of turning out their pigs on this land, and each <i>hoag</i> had to keep in proper repair the parts of the wall adjacent to it. Each had, however,
usually an enclosure on its own land for its own pigs, when young. The proprietary
water ran from the foreshore to the reef, a continuation of the strip on shore. At
Noatau and Matusa, where it is very broad, it was to some extent cross-divided. It
consists of a sand flat covered by 10–12 feet of <span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>water at high-tide. On it fish of all sorts are caught by traps and various devices,
and shell-fish are gathered. As these form no inconsiderable portion of the daily
food, indeed the principal animal food, the value of this property was always very
considerable. The reef—<i>i.e.</i> the part on the outside exposed at the low tide—was the common property of all. It
was explained to me that fish, crabs, etc., cannot be cultivated there, owing to the
heavy breaking seas, but are sent up by the <i>atua</i>, or spirits.” “Any land, not being planted, is willingly lent to another <i>hoag</i> on condition of two baskets of first-fruits of each patch being brought to the <i>pure</i>, but cocoanut trees on the land cannot be touched by the tenant, nor is he entitled
to their usufruct. If a <i>hoag</i> owns land in one district, but lives in another, first-fruits are always paid to
the chief of the district, in which its lands lie. Any encroachment on the land was
very vigorously resented, it was usually referred to the district chief to settle,
and his decision loyally adhered to.” “If he [a man] had planted more cocoanuts than
required by the <i>hoag</i>, he has the entire usufruct of these trees during his lifetime, quite independently
of the apportionment of the land below them for planting.” We see that the idea of
landownership is most fully developed here. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century the population has much diminished, and so “most of the <i>hoag</i> have far more land than they can cultivate.” But formerly it was otherwise. “Examining
the remains of planting, it appears as if the whole island, wherever practicable,
was at one time tilled. The land, where there is a good and deep soil, is, and was,
no doubt tilled regularly from year to year, while the rocky country was planted more
or less in rotation with yams and kava. Even on the steepest slopes, there are signs
of clearing, the summit alone being left crowned by the hifo. The bottoms of the craters
of many hills used to be planted too; in the crater of Sol Satarua, the <i>lulu</i> as it is termed, there are still bananas growing, but planted so long ago that the
fact that it had a <i>lulu</i> at all was almost forgotten”<a class="noteRef" id="n317.1src" href="#n317.1">37</a>. According to Hale, food was not always abundant on this island; therefore the natives
liked to engage themselves as sailors on <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>whaling-ships, until they had earned enough to buy a piece of land<a class="noteRef" id="n318.1src" href="#n318.1">38</a>. In Hale’s time land was evidently not so abundant as it is now that the population
is so rapidly declining.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti “every portion of land had its respective owner; and even the distinct trees
on the land had sometimes different proprietors, and a tree, and the land on which
it grew, different owners.” What our informant further tells us of the present state
of things as compared with that of earlier times, shows a remarkable likeness to Gardiner’s
statement about Rotuma. Ellis states that “an extent of soil capable of cultivation,
and other resources, are adequate to the maintenance of a population tenfold increased
above its present numbers.” But a great depopulation has taken place in the course
of years. “In the bottom of every valley, even to the recesses in the mountains, on
the sides of the inferior hills, and on the brows of almost every promontory, in each
of the islands, monuments of former generations are still met with in great abundance.
Stone pavements of their dwellings and court-yards, foundations of houses, and remains
of family temples, are numerous. Occasionally they are found in exposed situations,
but generally amidst thickets of brushwood or groves of trees, some of which are of
the largest growth. All these relics are of the same kind as those observed among
the natives at the time of their discovery, evidently proving that they belong to
the same race, though to a more populous era of their history. The stone tools occasionally
found near these vestiges of antiquity demonstrate the same lamentable fact.” According
to Moerenhout “landed properties constituted the principal, or rather the only wealth
of these people; therefore the power of the chiefs always depended on the quantity
and quality of their lands; moreover, the more people they could support, the more
sure they were of having subjects.” This writer does not, however, enter into many
details<a class="noteRef" id="n318.2src" href="#n318.2">39</a>.
</p>
<p>In Hawaii four social ranks existed. The members of the third rank, according to Ellis,
“are generally called haku aina, proprietors of the land.” “In the fourth rank may
be included <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>the small farmers, who rent from ten to twenty or thirty acres of land; the mechanics,
… indeed all the labouring classes, those who attach themselves to some chief or farmer,
and labour on his land for their food and clothing, as well as those who cultivate
small portions of land for their own advantage.” “Sometimes the poor people take a
piece of land, on condition of cultivating a given portion for the chief, and the
remainder for themselves, making a fresh agreement after every crop.” Hale states
that formerly there were no landed proprietors; all the land was “the property of
the king, and leased by him to inferior chiefs (<i>hatu aina</i>, landlords), who underlet it to the people; as the king, however, though absolute
in theory, was aware that his power depended very much on the co-operation of the
high chiefs, they became, to a certain degree, partakers in his authority.” Remy tells
us that the land belonged exclusively to the great chiefs, who leased it and received
considerable rents. Chamisso and Marcuse equally state that the land belonged to the
chiefs<a class="noteRef" id="n319.1src" href="#n319.1">40</a>.
</p>
<p>In Rarotonga, according to Gerland, a man’s power depends on the quantity of land
he owns. Meinicke states that there are four social classes. The third class is composed
of the landed proprietors; the lowest class are those who own no land and live as
tenants on the estates of the nobles<a class="noteRef" id="n319.2src" href="#n319.2">41</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Marquesas Islands, according to Gerland, three ranks formerly existed: chiefs,
landholders, and the common people. The landholders were the most powerful class;
the common people were obliged to pay them a tribute. Yet those who owned most land
were not always most respected, and even of the common people some owned land. Meinicke,
however, states that the whole of the land is the property of the nobles. Hale, after
speaking of the nobles, adds that the rest of the people were the landholders and
their relatives and tenants<a class="noteRef" id="n319.3src" href="#n319.3">42</a>.
</p>
<p>In Mangarewa (belonging to the Paumotu group) the nobles <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>were the proprietors of the soil; they often let out their lands to the third class,
the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n320.1src" href="#n320.1">43</a>.
</p>
<p>Meinicke tells us that in the Manahiki group the cocoanut trees and the lagoons (for
fishing purposes) were private property<a class="noteRef" id="n320.2src" href="#n320.2">44</a>.
</p>
<p>In an article, quoted by Schurtz, it is stated that in the Tokelau group the land
belongs exclusively to the nobles. Lister, speaking of Fakaofu or Bowditch Island
(in the Tokelau group), says: “Two islets belonged … to the king. Two others were
common property, and the rest were divided up as the property of individuals”<a class="noteRef" id="n320.3src" href="#n320.3">45</a>. So it seems that in this part of the group there was land which had not yet been
appropriated.
</p>
<p>In the Abgarris, Marqueen and Tasman groups all the land belongs to the chiefs and
the nobles, the common people having no landed property<a class="noteRef" id="n320.4src" href="#n320.4">46</a>.
</p>
<p>Tregear has the following notes on landed property in New Zealand: “Land was held
primarily by tribal right; but within this tribal right each free warrior of the tribe
had particular rights over some portion. He could not part with the land because it
was not his to give or sell, but he had better rights to certain portions than others
of his tribe. He would claim by having the bones of his father or grandfather there,
or that they once rested there; or by the fact of his navel-string having been cut
there; or by his blood having been shed on it; or by having been cursed there; or
by having helped in the war party which took the land; or by his wife being owner
by descent; or by having been invited by the owners to live there.” Thomson states
that “all free persons, male and female, constituting the nation were proprietors
of the soil.” The chiefs were the greatest landholders. “Conquest and occupation gave
titles to land. The right of fishing in rivers and sea belonged to the adjoining landed
proprietor. Amongst the families of each tribe there are also laws regarding landed
property. Thus the cultivation of a portion of forest land renders it the property
of those who cleared it, and this right descended from generation to generation.…
It was illegal for one family to <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>plant in another’s clearing without permission”. “The independence and social happiness
of the people were chiefly caused by cultivating their own lands.” According to Taylor,
each tribe had its own district; “each member can cultivate any portion of it he thinks
fit, if unoccupied, or if it has not been previously cultivated by another.” Polack
says: “Possession is obtained by planting a portion (however small) of the soil, and
reaping the same”<a class="noteRef" id="n321.1src" href="#n321.1">47</a>.
</p>
<p>On Easter Island, according to Geiseler, every piece of land has its own name and
its owner. The natives attach much value to landed property<a class="noteRef" id="n321.2src" href="#n321.2">48</a>.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We see that on most Polynesian islands all land has, or had been appropriated. Regarding
Rotuma, Tahiti and Easter Island this is explicitly stated; and the same must be the
case in Tonga, Hawaii, Rarotonga, the Marquesas Islands, Mangarewa, part of the Tokelau
group, and the Abgarris, Marqueen and Tasman groups, where classes destitute of land
are found. In Manahiki property in land was strongly developed; but whether there
was still free land is not clear. In Samoa there was still unappropriated bush land,
though this was already “sometimes claimed by those who own the land on its borders.”
In New Zealand clearing was still a <i lang="la">modus acquirendi</i>, which proves that all land had not yet been appropriated. Equally on Savage Island
titles can be acquired by cultivation.

<p class="first">Kubary tells us that the population of Ebon, and of the whole Rallik group (in the
Marshall Islands), consists of four ranks. “The common people are called <i><span class="corr" id="xd32e17438" title="Source: armij">armidj</span> kajur</i> and form the greater part of the subjects. They have no property, except the land
allotted to them by the chief, who can take it from them at his pleasure. Every week
they have, each of them, to provide the chief with prepared food, the quantity and
quality of which are determined. The next class are the <i>leotakatak</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>who hold their property by hereditary right and not from the chief. The chief cannot
take the property of these men unless he kills them first.” “The punishments inflicted
by the chiefs in former times consisted most often in capital punishment, and more
rarely, in less serious cases, in confiscation of land and house”<a class="noteRef" id="n322.1src" href="#n322.1">49</a>.
</p>
<p>Several other writers affirm that in the Marshall group the upper classes are the
sole proprietors of the soil and the common people are destitute of land<a class="noteRef" id="n322.2src" href="#n322.2">50</a>.
</p>
<p>Regarding the isle of Nauru we are told that not only every inch of land and every
palm, but even the reefs and the sea washing them, are held as property<a class="noteRef" id="n322.3src" href="#n322.3">51</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Pelau Islands the right of disposing of the land of the tribe vests in the
<i>obokúl</i> (chief of a family-group); but he cannot alienate any land without the consent of
his nephews. However, a regular agriculture does not exist, and most of the land remains
untilled; therefore the opposition of the nephews generally bears a formal character;
they only aim at extorting a present from the <i>obokúl</i>. The <i>obokúl</i> divides the land among the members of the tribe for cultivation. He may also cede
pieces of land to aliens for use without payment; such persons then enter into the
position of <i>kaukáth</i>, <i>i.e.</i> they are considered as related to the tribe without possessing the same rights, they
occasionally provide the <i>obokúl</i> with food, and help him in his work. In another place our informant states that there
is not often reason for disputes about land, as the population is scarce and large
tracts of land are uncultivated<a class="noteRef" id="n322.4src" href="#n322.4">52</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Mortlock Islands the chief of each tribe has an unlimited right to dispose
of the land belonging to the tribe. He divides it among the heads of families on condition
of their paying a tribute in kind. The latter assign to each member of their groups
a piece of land for cultivation. Most land is divided up between the several <i>keys</i> (family-groups); the land which is not yet occupied is the property of the principal
<i>key</i> and thus more directly than the rest at the disposal of the chief<a class="noteRef" id="n322.5src" href="#n322.5">53</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the isle of Kusaie twelve principal chiefs own all the land; but the chiefs of
the second rank administer and cultivate it for them. The common people are obliged
to pay a tribute to the chiefs and serve them. The highest mountains are planted up
to their summits with bananas, taro, sugarcane, etc<a class="noteRef" id="n323.1src" href="#n323.1">54</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Eastern Caroline Islands the land belongs exclusively to the two upper classes;
the third class are attached to the soil on which they live<a class="noteRef" id="n323.2src" href="#n323.2">55</a>.
</p>
<p>Hale states that in Ponape or Ascension Island there are three classes. All the land
belongs to the two upper classes. The estates are never alienated and pass only by
succession<a class="noteRef" id="n323.3src" href="#n323.3">56</a>.
</p>
<p>Gerland tells us that on the Marianne Islands the nobles were hereditary owners of
the whole of the land<a class="noteRef" id="n323.4src" href="#n323.4">57</a>.
</p>
<p>As to the Kingsmill Islands, the particulars given <span class="corr" id="xd32e17524" title="Source: bij">by</span> Wilkes and Parkinson, as quoted in the second chapter of Part I<a class="noteRef" id="n323.5src" href="#n323.5">58</a> sufficiently prove that all land had been appropriated. According to Wilkes “any
one who owns land can always call upon others to provide him with a house, canoe,
and the necessaries of life; but one who has none is considered as a slave, and can
hold no property whatever.” Hale tells us that “the <i>katoka</i> are persons not originally of noble birth, who either by the favour of their chief
or by good fortune in war, have acquired land and with it freedom”<a class="noteRef" id="n323.6src" href="#n323.6">59</a>. If in Wilkes’ statement we read “proletarian” instead of “slave,” and take Hale’s
“freedom” in an economic, not in a legal sense, we find that here too the lowest class
were destitute of landed property.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The conclusion is that on most of the islands of Micronesia all land has been appropriated,
most often by the upper classes to the exclusion of the lower. In Pelau, though a
vast amount of land is actually out of tillage, the regulation of landed property
related by Kubary proves that all land is held as property. Here, as well as in Rotuma
and Tahiti, we have to deal with the effects of the depopulation that has taken place
in Oceania. In Mortlock there seems to be free land; but Kubary’s account is not very
clear.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Codrington, in his article “On social regulations in Melanesia,” remarks that his
observations “are limited to the Northern New Hebrides, the Banks Islands, the Santa
Cruz Group, and the South-eastern Solomon Islands”<a class="noteRef" id="n324.1src" href="#n324.1">60</a>. Of land tenure he says: “Land is everywhere divided into (1) the Town, (2) the Gardens,
(3) the Bush. Of these the two first are held as property, the third is unappropriated.…
Everywhere, or almost everywhere, the abundance of land makes it of little value.
If an individual reclaims for himself a piece of bush land, it becomes his own”<a class="noteRef" id="n324.2src" href="#n324.2">61</a>.
</p>
<p>Somerville, speaking of New Georgia (one of the central Solomon Islands, and therefore
not included in Codrington’s description) remarks: “Property seems to be well recognised:
every one of the myriad islets of the great eastern lagoon has its understood owner,
no matter if cocoanuts be growing there or not. Groves of cocoanut trees are well
protected by <i>hopes</i>, as before described, as are also taro patches. Hunting rights over opossums on a
man’s property are also protected by <i>hopes</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="n324.3src" href="#n324.3">62</a>. Ribbe, however, states that in the New Georgia group, uncultivated land, <i>i.e.</i> bush and forest, has no owner, except the parts planted with sago trees and fruit
trees. Every one may clear and cultivate this land and so acquire a right of property<a class="noteRef" id="n324.4src" href="#n324.4">63</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Shortland Islands, near Bougainville (N.&nbsp;W. Solomon Islands), landed property
in the European sense does not exist. Everybody has the right to take a part of the
wood into cultivation. By doing so, he acquires a right of property, but only for
so long as he has the land in use<a class="noteRef" id="n324.5src" href="#n324.5">64</a>.
</p>
<p>Woodford describes the regulation of landed property in the Solomon Islands in general
in the following terms: “As to the system of land tenure among them, I believe that
to land, <i>per se</i>, they attach but little value. Any individual of the tribe appears to be able to
select at will a piece of land from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>forest, which he clears, fences in, and upon it rears his crop of yams or bananas.
After the crops are taken off, the land is allowed to relapse again to forest. When,
however, a native plants cocoanuts his property appears to be in the trees themselves,
apart altogether from any idea of ownership in the land upon which they are planted.
I do not think that any objection would be raised to another native utilizing the
ground upon which the cocoanuts were planted for other crops so long as the trees
themselves were in no way damaged or interfered with. Property in cocoanuts appears
to pass, upon a man’s death, to his heirs”<a class="noteRef" id="n325.1src" href="#n325.1">65</a>.
</p>
<p>Of land tenure on the isle of Aneityum, in the New Hebrides, Inglis says: “There is
neither a town nor a village in the whole Island. The system of cottage farming is
in a state of full development there. There is no large proprietor, no powerful or
wealthy chief; every man sits proprietor of his own cottage, his own garden, and his
own cultivated patches—you could not call them fields. The waste lands and the forests,
to the summits of the mountains, belong to the tribe. They are a kind of crown lands,
but what each man cultivates belongs to himself”<a class="noteRef" id="n325.2src" href="#n325.2">66</a>.
</p>
<p>In New Caledonia, according to Brainne, a noble’s authority depends on the range of
cultivated grounds he owns, and one who possesses large tracts of cultivated land
and large plantations of cocoanut trees is called a great chief. Glaumont tells us
that “property is acquired by purchase or exchange. It may also be acquired by labour.
Thus uncultivated grounds belong to the tribe, are so to speak common property; but
if a Kanaka clears and cultivates a portion of this bush land it passes into his property.
Property is held sacred (viz. in time of peace); the chief himself, however powerful,
would not dare to take away the field of taros or ignames from the least of his subjects.”
Lambert tells us that individual property in land is highly developed. The forest
land, however, has no owner; every one may take a portion of it into cultivation and
by doing so acquire a right of property. Meinicke says: “Each tribe possesses a separate
territory in which the land fit for <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>cultivation is the individual property of the chiefs and nobles, whereas the rest
is at the disposal of all.” According to Rochas there are two ranks: nobles and common
people; but the latter enjoy a rather independent position and always own some land.
The rights of property in land are highly respected, even by the chiefs<a class="noteRef" id="n326.1src" href="#n326.1">67</a>.
</p>
<p>Williams, describing Fiji, speaks of a feudal government; but he adds that the ancient
divisions of landed property are much respected. Seemann states that the “real power
of the state resides in the landholders or gentry”; and Hale tells us that the members
of the lowest class “work for the chiefs and landholders and are supported by them.”
The fullest account of land tenure in Fiji is given by Fison. The lands are of three
kinds. “1. The <i>Yavu</i> or Town-lot; 2. The <i>Qele</i>, or Arable Land; and 3. the <i>Veikau</i>, or Forest.” “The town-lots and the arable lands are divided among the <i>taukei</i> (landowners), while the forest lands are held in common by them. Arable land also,
which is not in actual use, is in some places common to a certain extent.” “The land
is vested in—or, at any rate, is held by—certain joint tribal owners who have a common
descent. These are called the <i>Taukei ni vanua</i> or owners of the land.… Not all the people are landowners.” Fison then speaks of
some classes destitute of land, of whom it is not quite clear whether they are tenants
or serfs. But the following statement of his clearly shows that all land has been
appropriated: “In addition to the <i>koro</i> [villages] already mentioned, there are others inhabited by tribes who have either
migrated from their own lands owing to disagreement with their kinsfolk, or have been
driven thence by war. These emigrants beg land from a <i>taukei</i> tribe, and settle down upon it. They are not landowners where they are now living,
but it does not follow that they are <i>kaisi</i> [base-born men, who are very much despised]. If they were <i>taukei</i> in their own land they cannot be placed on the level of the people without a father.”
They pay “rent of produce and service.… Tribes such as these are tenants at will,
and the land may be taken from them whenever it <span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>may be required. How long soever their occupation may continue, it does not establish
a title. The descendants of the <i>taukei</i> can always resume the lands, upon giving formal notice, and presenting some property
or other, which is called “the falling back of the soil”<a class="noteRef" id="n327.1src" href="#n327.1">68</a>. These emigrants are neither slaves nor serfs, but destitute of land; if there were
free land fit for cultivation, they would appropriate it instead of becoming tenants
at will.<span class="corr" id="xd32e17627" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>On the Gazelle Peninsula of Neu Pommern, according to Pfeil, uncultivated land as
such is not claimed by any one as his property. When a native wants land, he takes
some piece which is not in use, without having to ask leave of anybody. Hahl also
states that in the Northern part of the Gazelle Peninsula grass or forest land as
a rule is at the disposal of whoever wishes to cultivate it. Equally among the Baining
of the Gazelle Peninsula, as Parkinson tells us, the land is regarded as private property
as long as it is being cultivated<a class="noteRef" id="n327.2src" href="#n327.2">69</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Nissan Islands poverty is unknown, as there is an abundance of free land. Private
property in land is acquired by taking it into cultivation. Land is sold and leased<a class="noteRef" id="n327.3src" href="#n327.3">70</a>.
</p>
<p>Haddon, in his article on the Western Tribes of Torres Straits, remarks: “I have no
precise information as to land laws, but I believe that the whole of the land is divided
up into properties, certainly the arable land is, the chief sharing like anyone else.
There is no one person or class of landowners who possess land to the total exclusion
of anyone else. Title to land is derived from inheritance, gift or purchase. I never
heard of any means of conveyance”<a class="noteRef" id="n327.4src" href="#n327.4">71</a>.
</p>
<p>Hunt, describing the Murray Islands, says: “The chiefs held only their own hereditary
lands, but the first fruits of all cultivated lands were presented to them as their
share.… Any dispute about land would be settled by the old men who would meet and
discuss the point in dispute and then pronounce their decision. Land was never sold,
but could be leased, when, <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>if used for planting, a share in the first fruits would be paid to the owner”<a class="noteRef" id="n328.1src" href="#n328.1">72</a>.

</p>
<p>From the foregoing it appears that in many parts of Melanesia clearing is a <i lang="la">modus acquirendi</i>, viz. in the Solomon Islands, Northern New Hebrides, Banks Islands, Santa Cruz Group,
New Caledonia, Gazelle Peninsula of Neu Pommern and Nissan Islands. Yet the rights
of landowners are recognized everywhere in these islands. Here, as Ricardo would say,
land of the second degree of fertility has already been taken into cultivation, and
so rent has commenced on that of the first; but there is still free land. In Aneityum,
too, there seems to be land not yet appropriated. In Fiji people destitute of land
are found. Among the Western tribes of Torres Straits all arable land is divided up
into properties, as Haddon tells us; but whether the rest of the land is still free
is not quite clear. With regard to the Murray Islands we cannot arrive at any definite
conclusion.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Generally speaking we may conclude that in Polynesia and Micronesia all land has been
appropriated, whereas in the Melanesian Islands free land still exists.
</p>
<p>We see further that not only the arable land is held as property, but often also the
fruit-trees, lakes and streams, the shore and the lagoon as far as the reef. On most
Polynesian and Micronesian islands whatever portion of land or water can yield any
profit has been appropriated.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It appears from the foregoing paragraphs that in those islands where all land has
been appropriated, there are nearly always found people destitute of land. The only
exceptions are Rotuma and Pelau. Gardiner, in his very minute article on Rotuma, makes
no mention of social ranks; and Kubary, as we have already seen in the second chapter
of Part I, states that “among the Pelau islanders there is no question of a division
of the people into ranks or classes.” But Semper, as has also been shown in the same
chapter, speaks of a despised <span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>working class<a class="noteRef" id="n329.1src" href="#n329.1">73</a>. Regarding the social classes on Easter Island we are not sufficiently informed.
</p>
<p>Another state of things would not be inconceivable. It were quite possible that every
inhabitant had appropriated a portion of the land, nothing of it remaining unclaimed.
Yet it is easy to understand that, when all land has become individual property, a
class of people destitute of land is likely soon to arise. In large families the portions
falling to each of the children will often become too small to live upon. And where
it is customary to buy and sell land, there may be improvident people who squander
the land that was to afford them subsistence. But the principal cause probably is
the arbitrary conduct of the chiefs and other men of power who appropriate the land
of their enemies, and even, under some pretext, that belonging to their own subjects.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti the chiefs had “a desire for war, as a means of enlarging their territory,
and augmenting their power”<a class="noteRef" id="n329.2src" href="#n329.2">74</a>.
</p>
<p>Regarding Hawaii Ellis tells us: “When Tamehameha had subdued the greater part of
the islands, he distributed them among his favourite chiefs and warriors, on condition
of their rendering him, not only military service, but a certain proportion of the
produce of their lands<span class="corr" id="xd32e17690" title="Source: ,">.</span> This also appears to have been their ancient practice on similar occasions, as the
<i>hoopahora</i> or <i>papahora</i>, division of land among the <i>ranakira</i> or victors, invariably followed the conquest of a district or island”. Wilkes says:
“Any chieftain, who could collect a sufficient number of followers to conquer a district,
or an island, and had succeeded in his object, proceeded to divide the spoils, or
“cut up the land”, as the natives termed it. The king, or principal chief, made his
choice from the best of the lands. Afterwards the remaining part of the territory
was distributed among the leaders, and these again subdivided their shares to others,
who became vassals, owing fealty to the sovereigns of the fee. The king placed some
of his own particular servants on his portion as his agents, to superintend the cultivation.
The original occupants who were on the land, usually remained <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>under their new conqueror, and by them the lands were cultivated, and rent or taxes
paid.” Remy equally states that a victorious chief gave the lands of the conquered
party to his followers<a class="noteRef" id="n330.1src" href="#n330.1">75</a>.
</p>
<p>On Niué (Savage Island), “in fighting times the braves (<i>toa</i>) ignored all rights and seized upon any land that they were strong enough to hold”<a class="noteRef" id="n330.2src" href="#n330.2">76</a>.
</p>
<p>On Nauru the chief had the right to keep all the land his tribe had conquered for
himself or distribute it among the other chiefs of the tribe<a class="noteRef" id="n330.3src" href="#n330.3">77</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Kingsmill Islands the <i>katoka</i> are persons who “either by the favour of their chief or by good fortune in war, have
acquired land”<a class="noteRef" id="n330.4src" href="#n330.4">78</a>. Hence it appears that, here too, the victors used to occupy the lands of the conquered.
</p>
<p>In Fiji, according to Waterhouse, one of the motives of war was the desire for land.
Williams also states that each government “seeks aggrandizement at the expense of
the rest” by means of conquest, and he adds that the inhabitants of conquered districts
were reduced to an abject servitude. According to Wilkes, “the victorious party often
requires the conquered to yield the right of soil”. Fison says: “It is certain that
in former days, when population seems to have been on the increase … tribes were dispossessed
of their lands by other tribes who took them into their occupation, and are the <i>tauke</i> of the present day”<a class="noteRef" id="n330.5src" href="#n330.5">79</a>.
</p>
<p>We have seen in § 5 that a New Zealander sometimes claimed land “by having helped
in the war party which took the land.” According to Ellis, a desire to enlarge their
territory led to frequent wars. Thomson tells us: “Sometimes whole tribes became nominally
slaves, although permitted to live at their usual places of residence, on the condition
of catching eels and preparing food for their conquerors at certain seasons”<a class="noteRef" id="n330.6src" href="#n330.6">80</a>.
</p>
<p>In New Caledonia the inhabitants of conquered districts have <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>to pay a tribute to the conqueror, but generally continue living under their own chiefs<a class="noteRef" id="n331.1src" href="#n331.1">81</a>.
</p>
<p>Von Bülow states that in Samoa conquered lands become the private property of the
victorious chief<a class="noteRef" id="n331.2src" href="#n331.2">82</a>.
</p>
<p>It appears that this conquering of land does not always create a class destitute of
land; sometimes the inhabitants have only to pay a tribute. But where individuals
belonging to the victorious tribe receive portions of the conquered land allotted
to them, as in New Zealand and the Kingsmill Islands, or where, as in Samoa, the land
becomes the private property of the conquering chief, the original owners consequently
are deprived of their property.
</p>
<p>It also occurs that within the tribe the land is taken away from its owner.
</p>
<p>Williams states that in Fiji an adulterer may be deprived of his land as a punishment;
and Fison tells us that the chiefs have overridden the ancient customs regarding land
tenure<a class="noteRef" id="n331.3src" href="#n331.3">83</a>.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti, those who resisted the king’s authority were banished and deprived of their
lands. “Should the offender have been guilty of disobedience to the just demands of
the king, though the lands might be his hereditary property, he must leave them, and
become, as the people expressed it, a “wanderer upon the road”<span class="corr" id="xd32e17763" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="n331.4src" href="#n331.4">84</a>.
</p>
<p>In Niué, widows and orphans “are frequently robbed of the land inherited from their
dead husbands and fathers”<a class="noteRef" id="n331.5src" href="#n331.5">85</a>.
</p>
<p>In Ebon, confiscation of land by the chief was formerly a mode of punishment<a class="noteRef" id="n331.6src" href="#n331.6">86</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Kingsmill Islands, if a noble girl were to have connection with a man of the
middle class, she would lose her landed property<a class="noteRef" id="n331.7src" href="#n331.7">87</a>.
</p>
<p>On Nauru, according to Krämer, a murderer in most cases has to yield his land to the
parents of his victim. Jung tells us that formerly the chiefs often had to settle
disputes about land among their subjects. They then generally took the land from the
<span class="corr" id="xd32e17788" title="Source: quarelling">quarreling</span> parties and regarded it as their own<a class="noteRef" id="n331.8src" href="#n331.8">88</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the Melanesians described by Codrington the chiefs “often use their power to
drive away the owners of gardens they desire to occupy”<a class="noteRef" id="n332.1src" href="#n332.1">89</a>.
</p>
<p>Where land is so highly valued, and wealth and power depend upon the possession of
it, the chiefs and other men of power will be inclined to appropriate as much of it
as possible. This is not always easy, and sometimes, in democratically organized societies,
hardly practicable; but we may be sure that it will be done on the very first opportunity.
This is strikingly proved by what Gardiner tells us of Rotuma: “Since the introduction
of missionaries, too, much land has been seized by the chiefs, who, as a rule, in
each district were its missionaries, as fines for the fornications of individuals.
A certain amount of cocoanut oil was then given by the chiefs to the Wesleyan Mission,
apparently in payment for their support. The mission in the name of which it was done,
though generally without the knowledge of the white teachers, was so powerful that
the <i>hoag</i> had no redress.” Formerly individual rights to land in Rotuma were highly respected:
“The victorious side obtained no territorial aggrandisement, as it was to the common
interest of all to maintain the integrity of the land, and the victors might on some
future occasion be themselves in the <span class="corr" id="xd32e17806" title="Source: positon">position</span> of the vanquished”<a class="noteRef" id="n332.2src" href="#n332.2">90</a>. We may suppose that originally the chiefs were not powerful enough to appropriate
land belonging to others; but the additional power that the new religion gave them
enabled them to seize the lands of their subjects, and they immediately availed themselves
of this opportunity.
</p>
<p>A similar change has taken place in Samoa. In Turner’s time Samoan government had
“more of the patriarchal and democratic in it, than of the monarchical.” Von Bülow,
writing several years later than Turner, states that some chiefs have lately introduced
what he calls serfdom. In the villages where this state of things exists the inhabitants
live on land belonging to the chief. They pay no rent, but are obliged to stand by
the chief in war and peace. They are <span class="corr" id="xd32e17815" title="Source: personnally">personally</span> free and have the right to emigrate, but own no land<a class="noteRef" id="n332.3src" href="#n332.3">91</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>We can now perfectly understand why people destitute of land are found in so many
of these islands. And as most often not only the arable land, but fruit-trees, lakes,
streams, and the sea adjoining the land are individual property, these people are
entirely at the mercy of the landowners. We shall see that they have to perform the
drudgery for the landlords, and are sometimes heavily oppressed.
</p>
<p>In Tonga, the lowest class were the <i>tooas</i>. “The <i>tooas</i> can be divided into three categories. A few of them are warriors and form part of
the retinue of the chiefs; some are professed cooks in the service of the superior
or inferior chiefs; others, and these form the majority, till the soil. The latter
are found all over the country and have no other employment”<a class="noteRef" id="n333.1src" href="#n333.1">92</a>.
</p>
<p>“The institutions of Niué seem always to have been republican” says B. Thomson<a class="noteRef" id="n333.2src" href="#n333.2">93</a>.
</p>
<p>In Samoa, in Turner’s time, a democratic and even communistic <i>régime</i> prevailed. Speaking of the chief, Turner says: “With a few exceptions, he moves about,
and shares in everyday employments, just like a common man. He goes out with the fishing
party, works in his plantations, helps at house-building, and lends a hand at the
native oven.” The Samoans were very hospitable: “In addition to their own individual
wants, their hospitable custom in supplying, without money and without stint, the
wants of visitors from all parts of the group, was a great drain on their plantations.”
Hale states that “the common people are in general the relatives and dependents of
the <i>tulafales</i> [landlords] and have no direct influence in the government”<a class="noteRef" id="n333.3src" href="#n333.3">94</a>. We have seen that recently a class of people destitute of land has been created
by some chiefs; but their lot does not seem to be a hard one.
</p>
<p>Gardiner, in his description of Rotuma, makes no mention of social classes.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti, the lowest class were the <i>manahune</i>, including, besides the <i>titi</i> or slaves, “the <i>teuteu</i> or servants of the chiefs; all who were destitute of any land, and ignorant of the
rude <span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>arts of carpentering, building, etc., which are respected among them, and such as
were reduced to a state of dependence upon those in higher stations.” Speaking of
the great landholders, our informant says: “Possessing at all times the most ample
stores of native provisions, the number of their dependents, or retainers, was great.
The destitute and thoughtless readily attached themselves to their establishments,
for the purpose of securing the means of subsistence without care or apprehension
of want.” That the landholders enjoyed great consideration is also proved by Wilkes’s
remark, that the chiefs “find in their possession [of land] an acknowledged right
to rank and respectability”<a class="noteRef" id="n334.1src" href="#n334.1">95</a>.
</p>
<p>In Hawaii, four social ranks existed. The members of the third rank held land, “cultivating
it either by their own dependents and domestics, or letting it out in small allotments
to tenants.… In the fourth rank may be included the small farmers, who rent from ten
to twenty or thirty acres of land; the mechanics, namely, canoe and house builders,
fishermen, musicians, and dancers; indeed, all the labouring classes, those who attach
themselves to some chief or farmer, and labour on his land for their food and clothing,
as well as those who cultivate small portions of land for their own advantage.” “Sometimes
the poor people take a piece of land, on condition of cultivating a given portion
for the chief, and the remainder for themselves, making a fresh agreement after every
crop. In addition to the above demands, the common people are in general obliged to
labour, if required, part of two days out of seven, in cultivating farms, building
houses, etc. for their landlord. A time is usually appointed for receiving the rent,
when the people repair to the governor’s with what they have to pay. If the required
amount is furnished, they return, and, as they express it (<i>komo hou</i>), enter again on their land. But if unable to pay the required sum, and their landlords
are dissatisfied with the presents they have received, or think the tenants have neglected
their farm, they are forbidden to return, and the land is offered to another. When,
however, the produce brought is nearly equal to the required rent, and the chiefs
think the <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>occupants have exerted themselves to procure it, they remit the deficiency, and allow
them to return”<a class="noteRef" id="n335.1src" href="#n335.1">96</a>. This is quite the reverse of what occurs in slave countries. The slave or serf is
prevented from escaping and compelled to remain with his master; the Hawaiian tenant,
if the landlord is dissatisfied with the produce brought, is forbidden to return to
the land of his employer. In the same sense, Wilkes remarks: “What appears most extraordinary,
this bond [<i>i.e.</i> the bond between landlord and tenant] was more often severed by the superiors than
by their vassals”<a class="noteRef" id="n335.2src" href="#n335.2">97</a>.
</p>
<p>In Rarotonga, the lowest class are the <i>unga</i> or servants who have to cultivate the lands of the nobles, build their houses and
canoes, make nets for them, pay them tributes, and in general obey all their demands<a class="noteRef" id="n335.3src" href="#n335.3">98</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Marquesas Islands, the <i>kikinos</i> (common people) were servants and soldiers of the chiefs. They were always free to
leave their employers. The chief, in his turn, if he was not satisfied with a servant,
might expel him from his domain<a class="noteRef" id="n335.4src" href="#n335.4">99</a>. Here again we may mark the great difference between the lower classes of Polynesia
and slaves; for the latter are not expelled by way of punishment, but on the contrary
forced to remain with their masters.
</p>
<p>In Mangarewa, as has been noticed, the whole of the land belonged to the nobility,
who often leased their lands to the third class, the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n335.5src" href="#n335.5">100</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Tokelau group, the common people till the lands of the nobles for a payment
in kind. A labourer has the right to leave his employer and go into another man’s
service<a class="noteRef" id="n335.6src" href="#n335.6">101</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Abgarris, Marqueen and Tasman groups, the common people own no land; they serve
the members of the upper classes and form their retinue; in reward they are provided
with cocoanuts and other fruits and allowed to fish on the reef and in the lagoon<a class="noteRef" id="n335.7src" href="#n335.7">102</a>.
</p>
<p>In New Zealand, as has been shown in § 5, every freeman owned land. Accordingly, we
find only a beginning of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>formation <span class="corr" id="xd32e17914" title="Source: af">of</span> a class of free labourers. Polack states that “the poorest classes work as freedmen
on the farms of their richer relatives”<a class="noteRef" id="n336.1src" href="#n336.1">103</a>.
</p>
<p>On Easter Island, the king formerly held a despotic sway over the common people, <i>i.e.</i> those who did not belong to the nobility<a class="noteRef" id="n336.2src" href="#n336.2">104</a>.
</p>
<p>Gerland remarks that the two principal classes, nobles and common people, were nowhere
in Polynesia less strictly separated than in Samoa and New Zealand. This strikingly
shows that the appropriation of the land was really the basis of Polynesian aristocracy;
for Samoa and New Zealand, as we have found, were almost the only Polynesian groups
in which there was still free land<a class="noteRef" id="n336.3src" href="#n336.3">105</a>.
</p>
<p>Regarding the condition of the common people in Micronesia we have already mentioned
many particulars in § 7 of the second chapter of Part I in inquiring whether they
were to be regarded as slaves, and in § 6 of this chapter in order to prove that all
land had been appropriated. We shall briefly repeat here what bears on their condition
and the work imposed upon them, adding such details as have not yet been mentioned.
</p>
<p>Steinbach states that in the Marshall Islands neither the lowest nor the next higher
class owns land, “but they are allowed to grow as much produce or catch as much fish
as is necessary for their sustenance. They have to perform certain services for the
chiefs, such as the cutting of <i>copra</i>”. And <span class="corr" id="xd32e17937" title="Source: Kramer">Krämer</span> tells us that the common people are a subjected class without property. The kings
have an absolute rule over the people and many islands are their exclusive property.
They may take as many women as they like from among the people as wives or concubines.
The common man has only one wife and even this one his superiors may take away at
their pleasure<a class="noteRef" id="n336.4src" href="#n336.4">106</a>.
</p>
<p>On Nauru, the lower classes (sometimes called “serfs” or “slaves” by the authors)
are in the service of the chiefs and nobles.
</p>
<p>In Ebon, the common people live on land allotted to them <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>by the chief who can take it from them at his pleasure. Every week they have, each
of them, to provide the chief with a fixed quantity of food.
</p>
<p>In Mortlock, according to Kubary, social ranks do not exist.
</p>
<p>On the isle of Kusaie the chiefs have unlimited power. The common people are obliged
to build houses and canoes for them and till their lands; the chiefs may always seize
the goods and command the services of the people; the cocoanuts, which are rare, are
for the chiefs alone; they receive a certain proportion of all the fish that is caught<a class="noteRef" id="n337.1src" href="#n337.1">107</a>.
</p>
<p>In Yap, the lowest class (whom Gräffe wrongly calls slaves) are obliged daily to provide
the upper classes with agricultural produce, and whenever the chiefs require it to
aid in constructing houses and canoes. Whatever they possess, even to their wives
and daughters, may at any time be required by the upper classes. Yet all labour is
not exclusively incumbent on them. They are only bound to definite taxes, viz. to
a tribute of victuals, and of mats and other materials for housebuilding; and their
“slave-state” consists rather in a low and dependent condition than in being taxed
with labour.
</p>
<p>On the Marianne Islands there were three classes: nobles, semi-nobles, and common
people. The common people were strictly separated from the nobles and entirely subjected
to them. They were not allowed to navigate or fish or take part in any other pursuit
followed by the nobles. Their principal occupations were tilling the soil, constructing
roads, building canoe-houses, making nets, carrying ammunition in war, cooking rice,
roots, etc. As they were forbidden to use canoes and fishing implements, the only
fish they could procure were eels, which the nobles disdained; and even these they
might only catch with the hand, not by means of nets or fish-hooks<a class="noteRef" id="n337.2src" href="#n337.2">108</a>.
</p>
<p>In Pelau, according to Kubary, there are no social classes; but the wants of the chiefs
are generally provided for by the work of dependent relatives, who are treated as
adopted children and may at any time leave their employers. Semper, however, speaks
of a despised working class.
</p>
<p>On the Kingsmill Islands, according to Parkinson, there are <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>two subjected classes. One is the class of the <i>te torre</i>, who live as vassals on the lands of the great landholders; they get a small piece
of land for their own use; they must provide their lord with men when at war, and
bring him the number of cocoanuts he desires, and what he needs for his household.
The lowest class are the <i>te bei</i> or <i>kaungo</i>. They have no property, no land to live upon; they live with the great landholders
by whom they are maintained; they on their part must work for their lords, <i>i.e.</i> fish, prepare food, etc. The lord, by giving them a piece of land, can raise them
to the class of the <i>te torre</i>. These two classes have no voice in government matters; they follow their lord without
grumbling; his will is their will; an offence against the lord is regarded by them
as a personal offence, and avenged as such. Generally no one marries outside his class.
In ordinary life there is no difference between master and vassal; they drink, dance,
and play together; they wear the same kind of dress.
</p>
<p>We shall inquire now what is the condition of the lower classes in Melanesia.
</p>
<p>Rochas states that in New Caledonia the common people enjoy a rather independent position;
they have to perform some services for the chiefs, which chiefly consist in cultivating
their lands; but they always own a piece of land themselves. They are, however, sometimes
killed by the upper chiefs for cannibal purposes. Glaumont enumerates the following
classes: sorcerers, warriors, common people, slaves. But he adds that the chief himself,
however powerful, would not dare to take away the field of taros or ignames belonging
to the least of his subjects. According to Brainne, there are two classes: numerous
chiefs of various kinds, and serfs, over whom the former, especially the superior
chiefs, have the right of life and death. Lambert, a good authority, remarks that
the only division of the people is that between the chiefs and their relatives and
the rest of the population, and observes that those writers are wrong who speak of
a class of nobles. The chief is not allowed to dispose of the property of his subjects<a class="noteRef" id="n338.1src" href="#n338.1">109</a>. So it seems that the natives here are rather democratically organized.
</p>
<p>In Fiji, according to Williams, the lower classes were formerly <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>heavily oppressed. The chiefs looked upon them as their property, and took away their
goods and often even their lives; this was considered “chief-like.” “Subjects” says
Williams “do not pay rent for their land, but a kind of tax on all their produce,
beside giving their labour occasionally in peace, and their service, when needed,
in war, for the benefit of the king or their own chief.” Waterhouse states that many
poor men could not procure a wife; they then borrowed one from a chief, and so became
his retainers. Fison, speaking of the inhabitants of certain villages, says: “These
are of the lowest rank, or rather of no rank at all. They are <i>kaisi</i>, the descendants of “children without a father.” They are <i>vakatau ni were</i> (husbandmen), but they are not yeomen like the <i>taukei</i>. Neither the lands they cultivate, nor the town lots on which they dwell are their
own. They are not even tenants. They are hereditary bondsmen, <i lang="la">adscripti glebae</i>, whose business it is to raise food for their masters. Their lords may oppress them,
and they have no redress. In times of peace they must work for them and in war time
they must fight for them to the death”. According to Wilkes, “in each tribe great
and marked distinctions of rank exist. The classes which are readily distinguished
are as follows: 1. kings; 2. chiefs; 3. warriors; 4. landholders (<i>matanivanua</i>); 5. slaves (<i>kai-si</i>).” In another passage he speaks of “the kai-si or common people”. In Jackson’s narrative,
quoted above, mention is also made of these <i>kai-si</i> or inhabitants of “slave lands”<span id="xd32e18005"></span><a class="noteRef" id="n339.1src" href="#n339.1">110</a>.
</p>
<p>Codrington remarks: “In the native view of mankind, almost everywhere in the islands
which are here under consideration [Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz Group, Banks’ Islands,
and New Hebrides], nothing seems more fundamental than the division of the people
into two or more classes, which are exogamous, and in which descent is counted through
the mother.… Generally speaking, it may be said that to a Melanesian man all women,
of his own generation at least, are either sisters or wives, to the Melanesian woman
all men are either brothers or husbands”<a class="noteRef" id="n339.2src" href="#n339.2">111</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> This seems to be sufficient proof that a subjected and despised lowest class does
not exist; else the natives would not all be “brothers” and “sisters”.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>This conclusion is strengthened by consulting some other writers.
</p>
<p>Guppy, describing the Solomon Islands, makes no mention of social ranks. Elton states
that the chiefs have little power<a class="noteRef" id="n340.1src" href="#n340.1">112</a>. Nor have we found in any of the other writers anything tending to prove that the
common people are oppressed.
</p>
<p>Regarding the New Hebrides, Hagen and Pineau, after speaking of the chiefs, state
that the next class are the warriors, which rank can be obtained by a payment of pigs.
They make no mention of a despised or oppressed working class. Inglis, as we have
seen above, states that in the isle of Aneityum “there is no large proprietor, no
powerful or wealthy chief; every man sits proprietor of his own cottage, his own garden,
and his own cultivated patches.” Turner, speaking of the isle of Tana, says: “The
affairs of this little community are regulated by the chiefs and the heads of families”;
and in Eromanga, according to the same writer, the chiefs “were numerous, but not
powerful”. According to Ribbe, in the Shortland Islands (near Bougainville), the chiefs
have little power<a class="noteRef" id="n340.2src" href="#n340.2">113</a>. From all this we may safely conclude that social life in the New Hebrides is democratically
organized.
</p>
<p>In the Gazelle Peninsula of Neu Pommern wealth gives power; but there is no social
or political difference between the rich and the poor<a class="noteRef" id="n340.3src" href="#n340.3">114</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Nissan Islands poverty is unknown, as there is an abundance of free land fit
for cultivation. Social classes do not exist. There is no nobility, unless the chief
and his relatives be regarded as such<a class="noteRef" id="n340.4src" href="#n340.4">115</a>.
</p>
<p>Parkinson states that among the Moanus of the Admiralty Islands the power of the chiefs
is considerable<a class="noteRef" id="n340.5src" href="#n340.5">116</a>. We do not, however, hear of a subjection of the common people by the upper classes.
</p>
<p>Haddon, speaking of the Western Tribes of Torres Straits, says: “Each household is
practically self-sufficient. So far as I could gather there was no division of labour
as between man and man, every man made his garden, fished and fought”<a class="noteRef" id="n340.6src" href="#n340.6">117</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hunt, in his description of the Murray Islands, makes no mention of social ranks.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we may conclude that in Polynesia and Micronesia there are lower
classes destitute of land and entirely at the mercy of the landholders, whereas in
Melanesia such classes do not exist. This agrees with our former conclusion, that
in the two first-named geographical districts all land has, or had been appropriated,
which is not the case in Melanesia. And if we consider the single groups of islands,
we find that wherever in Polynesia there is still free land (Samoa, New Zealand),
a more or less democratic <i>régime</i> prevails, and where in Melanesia all land has been appropriated (Fiji) there is a
subjected lower class. In the same sense, Moerenhout, speaking of Polynesia, remarks
that, in the sparsely populated islands the chiefs had little power, but wherever
there was a dense population, wars were frequent and the chiefs reigned despotically<a class="noteRef" id="n341.1src" href="#n341.1">118</a>. There are, as we have already remarked, a few exceptions to this general rule (Rotuma,
Pelau); but in these cases it is quite possible that a subjected class formerly existed.
For a great depopulation has taken place in Oceania, especially in Polynesia and Micronesia<a class="noteRef" id="n341.2src" href="#n341.2">119</a>; and the value of land must have decreased together with the population. We have
seen that in Rotuma all land is still held as property, but large tracts are out of
tillage, though there are everywhere traces of former cultivation. In Pelau too, as
has been said in § 6, the rights of property are still recognized, though there is
but little land actually in cultivation. That the class of people destitute of land
tends to disappear when the population decreases, is strikingly shown by the following
statement of Ellis’s regarding Tahiti: “Although the <i>manahune</i> [lowest class] have always included a large number of the inhabitants, they have
not in modern times been so numerous as some other ranks. Since the population has
been so greatly diminished, the means of subsistence so abundant, and such vast portions
of the country uncultivated, an industrious individual has seldom experienced much
difficulty in securing at least the occupancy of a piece of land”<a class="noteRef" id="n341.3src" href="#n341.3">120</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span></p>
<p>This depopulation may perhaps also account for the discrepancy between Semper’s and
Kubary’s accounts of Pelau. Semper spoke of a despised working class; but Kubary,
who wrote several years after, stated that there were no social ranks. It is quite
possible that in the meantime the population had been so greatly diminished, that
every one could obtain possession of a piece of land.
</p>
<p>Ellis’s above-quoted statement also shows that there is a fundamental difference between
such lower classes as were found in Tahiti and slaves. The former were not at all
forbidden to provide for themselves, and indeed, when the population had decreased,
many of them began to cultivate a piece of land for their own profit. But in former
times they were not able to do so, as all land was the property of the upper classes.
The lower classes of Oceania were proletarians who wanted employment. The means of
subsistence were the exclusive property of the upper classes, and therefore the poor
were wholly dependent on them. In slave countries free labourers are not available,
and therefore those who want labourers have recourse to slavery; in Oceania the labour
market was overstocked, and therefore the poor eagerly asked the landlords for employment
even in the meanest work<a class="noteRef" id="n342.1src" href="#n342.1">121</a>.
</p>
<p>There are some more details on record proving that labourers were not wanted.
</p>
<p>In Rotuma “Polynesian or Micronesian strangers, <i>fa helav</i>, were usually married into different <i>hoag</i>, or adopted with the consent of all the members of the <i>hoag</i>. A few Fijians and Melanesians have become <i>fa asoa</i>, or helping men, of different chiefs; no women would have anything to do with them,
and no <i>hoag</i> would adopt them. They remained on the island as long as they liked, and transferred
their services as they liked; they were treated as inferior members of the <i>hoag</i>, to which they gave their services”<a class="noteRef" id="n342.2src" href="#n342.2">122</a>. In a slave country these Melanesians, looked upon as an inferior race and therefore
not adopted, would have been eagerly taken as slaves and prevented from escaping;
but here it is quite the reverse: they <span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>may stay if they like, but they may also go away if they like; nobody wants them.
</p>
<p>What Hale tells us of the inhabitants of Ponape is also very remarkable. When it is
feared that there will be over-population, some of the lower orders with their wives
and children voluntarily go away in their canoes<a class="noteRef" id="n343.1src" href="#n343.1">123</a>. If these lower classes were slaves, they would not be allowed to emigrate; the masters
would value them as their property and prevent them from escaping. Such is not the
case here; they remove because there is no room for them.
</p>
<p>We see that common labourers are little wanted in Oceania. Some kinds of workmen,
however, are much in request in some of these islands.
</p>
<p>Mariner states that in Tonga the esteem in which the different trades are held depends
on their utility. Most people pursue the same trade as their fathers did before them,
because they have learned it in their youth. This especially applies to those trades
which are considered most difficult and therefore highly honoured. There is no law
obliging a son to follow his father’s trade; but it is the custom; and the hope of
a high profit stimulates the energy of those who pursue a difficult trade. The noblest
trades are those of canoe-builder and undertaker of funerals. They are followed by
none but <i>mataboles</i> and <i>mooas</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> classes), the <i>tooas</i> (4<sup>th</sup> class) being excluded from them. All other trades are followed by <i>mooas</i> and <i>tooas</i> alike, except three which the <i>mooas</i> consider beneath their dignity and therefore leave to the <i>tooas</i>: those of barber, cook, and agriculturist. The latter two, the most <span class="corr" id="xd32e18136" title="Source: depised">despised</span> trades, are hereditary. Neither cooking nor cultivating requires any particular capacities,
everybody is capable of following these pursuits, and those whose fathers were engaged
in either of them have no alternative but to continue in the same way. The esteem,
however, in which an individual is held, does not only depend on the trade he follows,
but on his ability in it. He who distinguishes himself in a lower trade enjoys more
consideration than he who following a higher trade proves to be unqualified for it<a class="noteRef" id="n343.2src" href="#n343.2">124</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>We see that those trades which require no particular abilities are most despised here,
whereas skilled labour is highly honoured and performed even by the higher classes.
</p>
<p>In some more cases it is stated that skilled workmen are better paid and more highly
valued than unskilled.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti the lowest class included those “who were destitute of any land, and ignorant
of the rude arts of carpentering, building, etc., which were respected among them.…
The fishermen and artisans (sometimes ranking with this class, but more frequently
with that immediately above it) may be said to have constituted the connecting link
between the two”<a class="noteRef" id="n344.1src" href="#n344.1">125</a>.
</p>
<p>Wilkes states that in the Kingsmill Islands “the trade of carpenter is held in great
repute.” Professed tattooers are also highly esteemed and well paid<a class="noteRef" id="n344.2src" href="#n344.2">126</a>.
</p>
<p>In Fiji the carpenters formed a separate caste, called King’s carpenters, having chiefs
of their own, for whom and their work they showed respect. Among the social ranks
the 4<sup>th</sup> were distinguished warriors of low birth, chiefs of the carpenters, and chiefs of
the fishers for turtle, the 5<sup>th</sup> were the common people<a class="noteRef" id="n344.3src" href="#n344.3">127</a>. We see that here too skilled workmen rank above the bulk of the people.
</p>
<p>Skilled labour is thus highly valued in some of these islands. The skilled workmen,
so far from being slaves, are held in high esteem; but those who have no peculiar
accomplishments are obliged to perform the rudest and most despised work. This applies
especially to the agricultural labourers. These are entirely dependent on the landowners,
and there are more of them than can be profitably employed. They much resemble the
proletarians of modern European countries.
</p>
<p>The great significance of the appropriation of the land clearly appears, when we consider
a phenomenon frequently occurring among savages: debt-slavery. Among some savage tribes
there are rich and poor as well as in Polynesia; the poor, however, do not apply to
the rich for employment, but are enslaved by them. Thus among the Tagals and Visayas,
in the time of the <span lang="es">conquista</span>, most slaves had become such by being unable to pay debts they had contracted. If,
in a time of famine, a poor man <span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>had been fed for some days by his rich neighbour, he became his slave. Sometimes the
rich even placed a quantity of rice in some conspicuous place and lay on the look-out;
if then a poor man came and ate of the rice, he was seized and enslaved<a class="noteRef" id="n345.1src" href="#n345.1">128</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Such a thing would never have happened in Polynesia, and the reason why is evident.
Among the Tagals and Visayas the poor were able, in ordinary times, to provide for
themselves they did not offer their services to the rich; the latter had to avail
themselves of such an opportunity as a famine, to lay hands on them and compel them
to work for them, not only during the famine, but afterwards when, if free, they would
have been able to subsist independently of the rich. But in Polynesia the means of
subsistence are permanently in the hands of the rich to the exclusion of the poor;
therefore the rich need not compel the poor to work for them, for they are always
at their mercy. Among the Tagals and Visayas the poor, though destitute of wealth,
were not without resources: they had the free land always at their disposal; and it
was only in extraordinary circumstances (<i>e.g.</i> when the harvest had failed) that they were temporarily dependent on the rich. In
Polynesia the poor are destitute of land, and therefore permanently dependent on the
landlords.
</p>
<p>Their state would even be worse than it actually is, were it not that they are useful
in another, non-economic way: they strengthen their employers’ force in warfare.
</p>
<p>In Tahiti “in times of war, all capable of bearing arms were called upon to join the
forces of the chieftain to whom they belonged, and the farmers, who held their lands
partly by feudal tenure, were obliged to render military service whenever their landlord
required it. There were, besides these, a number of men celebrated for their valour,
strength, or address in war, who were called <i>aito</i>, fighting-men or warriors. This title, the result of achievements in battle, was
highly respected, and proportionably sought by the daring and ambitious. It was not,
like the chieftainship and other prevailing distinctions, confined to any class, but
open to all; and many from the lower ranks have risen, as warriors, to a high station
in the community”<a class="noteRef" id="n345.2src" href="#n345.2">129</a>.
</p>
<p>In Hawaii, “when war was declared, the king and warrior <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>chiefs, together with the priests, fixed the time and place for commencing, and the
manner of carrying it on. In the meantime, the <i>Runapai</i> (messengers of war) were sent to the districts and villages under their authority,
to require the services of their tenants, in numbers proportionate to the magnitude
of the expedition”<a class="noteRef" id="n346.1src" href="#n346.1">130</a>.
</p>
<p>In Samoa, as we have seen, those residing on land belonging to the chief were obliged
to stand by him in war and peace<a class="noteRef" id="n346.2src" href="#n346.2">131</a>.
</p>
<p>In Tonga, according to Mariner, “the retinue of the upper chiefs consists of <i>mataboles</i> or inferior chiefs (2<sup>nd</sup> class), and each of these has under his command a number of <i>mooas</i> (3<sup>rd</sup> class), who constitute the army of the upper chiefs. Some <i>tooas</i> (4<sup>th</sup> class) are also admitted into this army, if they have given proofs of bravery”<a class="noteRef" id="n346.3src" href="#n346.3">132</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Marquesas Islands the rank of a noble could be acquired through acts of bravery<a class="noteRef" id="n346.4src" href="#n346.4">133</a>.
</p>
<p>On the Kingsmill Islands the tenants must provide their lord with men when at war<a class="noteRef" id="n346.5src" href="#n346.5">134</a>.
</p>
<p>In Fiji, according to Williams, all men capable of bearing arms, of all classes, took
part in military operations; and Fison, as we have seen above, states that the people
of the lowest rank in war time had to fight for their lords to the death<a class="noteRef" id="n346.6src" href="#n346.6">135</a>.
</p>
<p>Concluding, we may remark that the facts observed in Oceania fully justify our theory,
that slavery is inconsistent with a state of society in which all land is held as
property.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conclusion we have arrived at is that the appropriation of the soil is a factor
of great importance in shaping the social life of agricultural peoples<a class="noteRef" id="n346.7src" href="#n346.7">136</a>. When all land is held as property, <span class="pageNum" id="pb347a">[<a href="#pb347a">347</a>]</span>a class of people destitute of the means of subsistence is likely soon to arise; such
people must seek employment and live on the wages they can earn. But in countries
where there <span class="corr" id="xd32e18264" title="Source: in">is</span> still free land, a class of free agricultural labourers dependent on wages does not
exist; therefore in such countries the landowners often resort to slavery as a means
of procuring labourers. <i>Generally speaking, slavery as an industrial system can only exist where there is
still free land.</i>
</p>
<p>If this theory is correct, it must hold not only with regard to the simply organized
societies of Polynesia and Micronesia, but also with regard to civilized nations.
Among such nations too slavery must disappear as soon as all land has been appropriated.
And as we know that in Western Europe all land is now held as property and everybody
is personally free, whereas in former times, when these countries were far less densely
peopled than now, slavery and serfdom existed, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose
that the appropriation of the soil has had much to do with the disappearance of servile
labour. This opinion is also held by Wakefield. “The serfdom of the middle-ages was
for all Europe, what it is for Poland and Russia still<a class="noteRef" id="n347.1src" href="#n347.1">137</a>, a kind of slavery required by the small proportion of people to land; a substitute
for hired labour, which gradually expired with the increase of population, as it will
expire in Poland and Russia when land shall, in those countries, become as scarce
and dear as it became in England some time after the conquest”<a class="noteRef" id="n347.2src" href="#n347.2">138</a>. We think Wakefield is quite right here, and we shall adduce some facts in corroboration
of this view.
</p>
<p>But we must first remind the reader of what we have already said in the Introduction.
We confine ourselves in this book to an investigation of the facts of savage life.
The study of these facts leads us to conclusions, some of which (and among these the
conclusion we are now dealing with) have a wider bearing and can further our understanding
of the history of civilized <span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>nations. But the scope of the present volume does not allow us to make any special
investigation of this history and inquire whether the same causes can be seen at work
here that have been found to shape the social life of savage tribes. Accordingly,
we shall not try to prove that the appropriation of the soil has really been the main
cause of the disappearance of slavery and serfdom in Western Europe. We only intend
to show that the matter can be viewed from this side. We wish to claim attention for
this important factor, that is commonly overlooked, and thus clear the way for future
research. This and the next two paragraphs have to be regarded as a digression, standing
apart from the main body of our book.
</p>
<p>The character of these paragraphs may justify us in limiting our remarks to two countries,
the economic history of which has of late years been the subject of thorough study
by eminent writers, viz. England and Germany, and using only a small part of the literature
existing on this matter. We have, however, taken care to consult none but first-rate
authorities.
</p>
<p>We have spoken of the disappearance of <i>slavery and serfdom</i>. In connection with this two remarks have to be made.
</p>
<p>First. Slavery in the strict sense existed for a long time in both England and Germany.
In England, shortly after the Norman Conquest, slaves were still rather numerous.
“The <i lang="la">servi</i> or slaves” says Ashley “whose average percentage for the whole land is 9, and who
in some of the eastern and midland shires do not appear at all, or fall to a percentage
of 4 or 5, rise in the country on the Welsh border and in the south-west to 17, 18,
21, and 24 per cent.” A century later, however, absolute slavery had disappeared<a class="noteRef" id="n348.1src" href="#n348.1">139</a>. And in Germany there was also a class of <i lang="la">servi</i>, who had to perform whatever services the lords might require, and even in the 11<sup>th</sup> century, though their condition had already much improved, were sometimes sold apart
from the land<a class="noteRef" id="n348.2src" href="#n348.2">140</a>.
</p>
<p>Secondly. The argument that leads us to conclude that slavery, is inconsistent with
a state of society in which all land is held as property, equally applies to serfdom.
For the serf, as well as the slave, was compelled to work. There is a great difference
between slaves and serfs on one side, and modern labourers <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>and tenants on the other. The labourer has to work for his employer, and the tenant
has to pay rent; but both can always declare the contract off and so put an end to
their obligations. And even as long as the contract lasts, if they do not discharge
their duties, they can only be condemned to pay damages; but the labourer cannot be
compelled to work, nor the tenant to remain on the farm. The slaves and serfs of early
times, however, were under personal compulsion. The slave was the property of his
master, whom he was not allowed to leave. And the serf, as we so often read, was “bound
to the soil,” “astricted to the estate”, “<i lang="de">an die Scholle gefesselt</i>”, which means that he was forbidden to remove from the spot assigned to him. Professor
Cunningham states that in England, in the 11<sup>th</sup> century “a very large proportion of the population were serfs who could not move
to other estates or to towns”<a class="noteRef" id="n349.1src" href="#n349.1">141</a>, and Amira tells us that in Germany, in the Middle Ages, the villeins (<i lang="de">Grundhörigen</i>) were not allowed to remove from the land which they cultivated<a class="noteRef" id="n349.2src" href="#n349.2">142</a>. Therefore our argument holds with regard to serfdom as well as slavery. For when
all land has been appropriated, a landlord can always find free tenants who are willing
to pay him a rent, and free labourers who are willing to work for him, and so he wants
neither serfs nor slaves. We may quote here Oppenheimer’s remark that, as soon as
all land has been appropriated, “serfdom in the proper sense, implying the astriction
of the labourer to the soil, has become superfluous. The labourer can safely be allowed
personal freedom, and it is allowed him. The produce of his labour can now be taken
from him, in the form of rent, though he may be personally free. For he is excluded
from the means of production, as far as they could be accessible to him, and so he
has to accept the terms of the proprietor or to starve”<a class="noteRef" id="n349.3src" href="#n349.3">143</a>.
</p>
<p>It is of some interest to emphasize what we have said concerning the difference between
serfs and free tenants. A free tenant, whatever be the conditions of his tenure, can
always remove from the land and cannot be compelled to cultivate it. A serf, whatever
be the extent of his obligations, is bound to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>soil; if he escapes the lord can bring him back and set him to work again. The right
of emigrating (German “<i lang="de">Freizügigkeit</i>”) is the true mark of freedom. And therefore, as soon as the obligations which were
personal have become territorial, <i>i.e.</i> as soon as the services and payments which formerly were exacted from definite persons,
are exacted from the cultivators of definite pieces of land as such, nobody being
any longer obliged to become or remain the cultivator of any definite piece of land,—serfdom
has ceased to exist, even though the services and payments have remained exactly the
same.
</p>
<p>The line of demarcation between free and unfree cultivators has not, however, always
been drawn in a strict, scientific manner. Ashley, speaking of the 11<sup>th</sup>—14<sup>th</sup> centuries, says: “The term <i lang="fr">libere tenentes</i> is elastic enough to cover men in very different positions.… But the larger number
of those known by that name were, clearly, virgate-holding villeins or the descendants
of such, who had commuted their more onerous labour services of two or three days
a week for a money or corn payment, and had been freed from what were regarded as
the more servile “incidents” of their position. What these exactly were, or, indeed,
what was understood by free tenure, it is difficult now to determine, precisely because
the lawyers and landlords of the time did not themselves know. The most widely spread
idea was that inability to give a daughter in marriage or to sell an ox or a horse
without the lord’s consent, for which a fine had to be paid, was the certain mark
of servile tenure”<a class="noteRef" id="n350.1src" href="#n350.1">144</a>.
</p>
<p>Now we cannot wonder that the lawyers and landlords of the Middle Ages had no very
clear ideas about serfdom and freedom. But modern writers on economic history should
have the true distinction always before their minds. Some of them, however, we think
fail in this respect.
</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate this we must speak of a change which, in the later Middle
Ages, took place in the manorial economy. The land belonging to each landlord had
always been divided into two parts, viz. “that part cultivated for the immediate benefit
of the lord, the <i>demesne</i> or <i>inland</i>, and that <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>held of him by tenants, the land <i>in villenage</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="n351.1src" href="#n351.1">145</a>. These tenants were not, however, free tenants, but villeins bound to the soil and
obliged to work on the demesne. “The whole of the land of the manor, both demesne
and villenage, was cultivated on an elaborate system of joint labour. The only permanent
labourers upon the demesne itself were a few slaves; all or almost all the labour
there necessary was furnished by the villeins and cotters, as the condition on which
they held their holdings, and under the supervision of the lord’s bailiff”. The labour
dues of the villeins consisted of <i>week work</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a man’s labour for two or three days a week throughout the year, <i lang="la">precariae</i>, <i>i.e.</i> additional labour at ploughing and at harvest time, and miscellaneous services<a class="noteRef" id="n351.2src" href="#n351.2">146</a>.
</p>
<p>But in the course of time money payments were largely substituted for these labour
dues. Commutation of the <i>week work</i> went on extensively shortly after the Norman Conquest, and commutation of the whole
of the services occurs occasionally as early as 1240. “With the reign of Edward II
complete commutation became general”<a class="noteRef" id="n351.3src" href="#n351.3">147</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> The cultivators had now to pay money to the lord instead of working on the demesne.
</p>
<p>Though the change occurred at a time when personal serfdom was gradually declining,
it is easy to see that this commutation is not identical with the transition from
serfdom to freedom. A free tenant may by contract take upon himself to perform some
kind of work for the landlord. This was the case in England where “the rendering of
services reappeared in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, not as the incidents
of villanage, but as a form of agreement which proved more or less convenient to one
party and perhaps to both”<a class="noteRef" id="n351.4src" href="#n351.4">148</a>. On the other hand, it is quite possible that a cultivator who pays money instead
of rendering services, is yet bound to the soil and devoid of personal freedom. Ashley,
speaking of the 13<sup>th</sup> century, states that most of the cultivators “had continued to hold by servile tenure,
as villeins or customary tenants, even when they had commuted all or most of their
services.… There can be no doubt that … they were bound to the soil; <span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>in the sense, at any rate, that the lord would demand a heavy fine before he would
give one of them permission to leave the manor”<a class="noteRef" id="n352.1src" href="#n352.1">149</a>.
</p>
<p>Now, though none of our writers on economic history explicitly say that these two
things, the commutation of labour dues for money and the transition from serfdom to
freedom, are identical, we think some of them do not sufficiently keep in view the
difference existing between the two. Thus only can we account for the prevalence of
a theory which seems to be the current mode of explaining the fall of serfdom and
rise of freedom.
</p>
<p>This theory has been introduced by a German writer, Professor Hildebrand. He distinguishes
three stages of economic development: natural economy, money economy, and credit economy.
</p>
<p>In the system of natural economy goods are exchanged directly for goods; when money
economy prevails use is made of a means of exchange, money; and when credit economy
has been developed goods are exchanged for a promise in the future to give back the
same or a like value, <i>i.e.</i> on credit. Every nation begins with natural economy, for the use of money as a means
of exchange supposes an abundance of labour or products of labour which enables people
to procure the precious metals. As long as natural economy prevails capital does not
exist: the soil and human labour are the only productive agencies. There are, therefore,
two classes of people only; labourers and landowners. Sometimes every landowner is
at the same time a labourer; in such cases democracy prevails. But it often occurs
that labourers and landowners form separate classes. These are then mutually dependent
on each other; for the labourer wants a landlord to give him employment and so enable
him to earn his subsistence, and the landlord wants labourers to cultivate his lands.
This interdependence effects that the relations existing between the two classes assume
a durable character. The labour contracts are made to last for the life of the labourer
or even become hereditary. The labourer is bound to the soil and forbidden to leave
the manor.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span></p>
<p>As soon as money economy exists, capital arises and takes its place as the third factor
of production. The owning classes comprise now both capitalists and landlords. The
labourer has no longer to apply to the landlord for employment, but can leave him
and work for the capitalist; he is therefore no longer astricted to the soil. The
wages he receives from the capitalist are paid in the form of money, and so the labourer
is much freer than before, for this money can be turned to various purposes. Moreover,
capital (as opposed to land) can be augmented to any extent, and this enables the
labourer to become a capitalist himself.
</p>
<p>The position of the labourers who remain on the land also undergoes a change. The
landlord who brings the agricultural produce to the market can pay wages in money
and therefore hire able and dismiss incompetent labourers. His lands, worked with
free labourers who serve for wages, yield him a far greater income than formerly when
they were cultivated by serfs. Moreover, the fixed labour dues of the serfs do not
answer the purposes of an improved economy. It is thus the interest of the landlord
to put an end to his fixed and hereditary contracts and loosen the ties with which
natural economy had bound the agricultural labourer. The dues in kind and services
are commuted for money payments. The labourer, who was a serf, becomes now either
a free peasant or a free servant and day-wage worker who is no longer astricted to
the soil, but can leave his employer whenever he likes and seek such work as most
agrees with his capacity and inclination.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the employers have become independent of the labourers. In the
system of natural economy the landlord took care not to lose his labourers, whom he
wanted to cultivate his land; but now landlords and capitalists can always get as
many labourers as they like and dismiss them as soon as they are no longer of any
use. This leads to an oppression of the poor by the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n353.1src" href="#n353.1">150</a>.
</p>
<p>This is Hildebrand’s theory, so far as the condition of the labouring classes is concerned.
Natural economy, according to him, leads to serfdom, money economy leads to freedom.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span></p>
<p>We think this theory is erroneous.
</p>
<p>It would perhaps be better not to speak of “natural economy” and “money economy”;
for these terms are likely to lead to misunderstanding. The mere existence of money
is of comparatively little consequence. A circulating medium arises as soon as it
is wanted; and where the precious metals are unknown something else will do, as in
Melanesia and among many Negro tribes, where shells are used for money. The existence
of a circulating medium denotes a development of commerce; for barter on any extensive
scale is hardly possible. Therefore we had better speak of self-sufficing and commercial
communities. As long as each village is practically self-dependent money is not wanted;
but as soon as the interchange of commodities takes any considerable dimensions the
need for a means of exchange becomes pressing. And there is, indeed, a great difference
in social structure between self-sufficing and commercial communities<a class="noteRef" id="n354.1src" href="#n354.1">151</a>; but if we ascribe this difference to the existence of gold and silver coins we arrive
at false conclusions. A proof of this is the fact that Hildebrand thinks capital can
only exist when there is money. Yet we know that the Germans have kept cattle from
early times, long before money economy prevailed; and cattle are decidedly to be called
capital; they cannot be classified under either of the only two means of production
which, according to Hildebrand, exist in a system of natural economy: land and human
labour; and in our chapter on pastoral tribes we have seen that cattle-keepers form
strongly marked capitalistic communities.
</p>
<p>But even if we speak of self-dependent and commercial communities, we cannot admit
that in the former labour must necessarily be servile and in the latter free.
</p>
<p>First. How can natural economy, <i>i.e.</i> the absence of commerce, lead to serfdom? Hildebrand says: landlords and labourers
are mutually dependent on each other, and so their relations assume a durable character,
and the labourer is astricted to the soil. <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>We think his meaning is the following. In self-sufficing communities the fluidity
of labour which exists in modern society, is wanting. In such countries there can
be famine in one district, whilst in a contiguous district there is plenty of food;
similarly labour can be scarce in one place whilst it is abundant in a neighbouring
place. Therefore a landlord cannot afford to let his labourers leave the manor; for
as there is little intercourse between the different villages and districts it is
difficult for him to procure other labourers. It is thus most convenient for him to
bind his labourers to the soil and forbid them to leave him.
</p>
<p>This may at first sight seem a reasonable explanation of the origin of serfdom. But
on closer scrutiny it will be seen that this argument does not hold. When there is
little intercourse, each landlord is dependent on the labourers of his own district;
and there must be a great stability in the relations of the two classes. But this
need not bring about an astriction of the labourers to the soil. The landlord cannot
easily procure labourers from other districts; but it is even more difficult for the
labourers to find employment in foreign parts; for such intercourse as there is, is
kept by the ruling, not by the labouring classes. Therefore it is not necessary to
bind the labourers to the soil; for they are already naturally dependent on the landlords
of their own district. We think slavery and serfdom can only be accounted for by a
general scarcity of labour. When labour is everywhere scarce a labourer who leaves
his employer can everywhere find employment, whereas an employer cannot easily procure
labourers; it is then the interest of the employer to prevent his labourers from leaving
him. But the mere lack of intercourse limits the labourer in his choice of employment
even more than it limits the employer in his choice of labourers.
</p>
<p>Nor do the facts agree with this theory. We have seen that among pastoral tribes free
labourers are frequently found, though labour is by no means fluid and the labourers
are paid in kind, not in money. Among the natives of Hawaii, who lived under a system
of natural economy, labour was also free. The passage in which Ellis describes the
relation between landlords and cultivators has already been quoted by us, but it is
<span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>remarkable enough to repeat here. “Sometimes the poor people take a piece of land,
on condition of cultivating a given portion for the chief, and the remainder for themselves,
making a fresh agreement after every crop. In addition to the above demands, the common
people are in general obliged to labour if required, part of two days out of seven,
in cultivating farms, building houses, etc. for their landlord. A time is usually
appointed for receiving the rent, when the people repair to the governor’s with what
they have to pay. If the required amount is furnished, they return, and, as they call
it (<i>komo hou</i>) enter again on their land. But if unable to pay the required sum, and their landlords
are dissatisfied with the presents they have received, or think the tenants have neglected
their farm, they are forbidden to return, and the land is offered to another. When,
however, the produce brought is nearly equal to the required rent, and the chiefs
think the occupants have exerted themselves to procure it, they remit the deficiency,
and allow them to return”<a class="noteRef" id="n356.1src" href="#n356.1">152</a>. These cultivators are by no means astricted to the soil. They make a fresh agreement
after every crop. If the produce brought is insufficient, they are either removed
or by way of favour allowed to return<a class="noteRef" id="n356.2src" href="#n356.2">153</a>.
</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that, though in medieval Western Europe serfdom and natural economy
existed at the same time, the former is not a necessary consequence of the latter.
</p>
<p>Secondly. Does money economy, <i>i.e.</i> commerce, always lead to freedom? We know now that serfdom is not invariably connected
with natural economy. Yet it might be that, wherever both natural economy and serfdom
exist (as it was the case in the early Middle Ages) the rise of money economy always
brought serfdom to a close.
</p>
<p>The argument by which Hildebrand attempts to prove this is rather strange. The development
of town life and manufactures, according to him, enables the labourers to find employment
in manufactures; they are now no longer dependent on the landlords. The manufacturing
capitalists pay them money-wages <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>which they can spend in whatever way they like, and so they become more free than
they were before.
</p>
<p>We think this argument is quite insufficient. The labourers find employment in manufactures,
says Hildebrand. But he had told us before that they were astricted to the soil. What
enables them now to leave the landlords? Further: why do not the town labourers become
slaves or serfs? Here Hildebrand’s reasoning is very strange. They receive money-wages
which they can spend in whatever way they like. Now one who receives money with which
he can buy all kinds of commodities is in a certain sense more free than one who,
under a system of natural economy, receives bread and meat which he cannot sell. But
this has nothing to do with the legal status of the labourer. A slave who receives
pocket-money from his master is free to buy with it what he likes, yet he remains
a slave.
</p>
<p>But the condition of those of the labouring classes who remain on the land also undergoes
a change, according to Hildebrand. The landlord can now sell the produce of his land
for money, and this money enables him to hire free labourers.
</p>
<p>We cannot see why this should be so, why the mere possibility of paying money-wages
(all other circumstances having remained the same) should lead to free labour contracts.
We should rather think that the afflux of labourers to the towns of which Hildebrand
speaks would make agricultural labour scarce, and each landlord would be most anxious
to retain those labourers that had not yet escaped to the towns; they would now, more
than ever before, be astricted to the soil.
</p>
<p>Hildebrand, however, thinks it will be the interest of the landlord to put an end
to the hereditary tenures of his serfs and work his lands with free labourers. And
he adds that the dues in kind and services are commuted for money payments. The cultivator
who was a serf becomes now either a free landholder or a free labourer.
</p>
<p>Whether Hildebrand means to say that the commutation of dues in kind and services
for money payments is identical with the transition from serfdom to freedom, does
not clearly appear.
</p>
<p>We think that the regarding of this commutation as the main fact in the economic history
of the later Middle Ages <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>lies at the root of the evil and has given rise to this theory. Money economy, according
to Hildebrand, leads to commutation, and commutation is the same as, or at any rate
leads to, the disappearance of serfdom.
</p>
<p>What does this commutation mean? Formerly the peasants had to work on the demesne
which was cultivated for the immediate benefit of the lord; in later times they paid
money instead. What was the reason of this change? It must have been that the demesne
was cultivated in some other way so that their services were no longer wanted. Sometimes
free labourers were employed. “It is evident” says Ashley “that the lord would not
have consented, first to partial and then to complete commutation, had he not been
able to hire labourers”<a class="noteRef" id="n358.1src" href="#n358.1">154</a>. But the main reason was that portions of the demesne were let for rents. “If the
lord found it his interest to let portions of the demesne instead of cultivating it
through his bailiff or reeve, his need for the services of the villeins would be <i>pro tanto</i> diminished, and he would be readier to accept commutation”<a class="noteRef" id="n358.2src" href="#n358.2">155</a>. The same was the case in Germany, where between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries the extent of the land which the landlords kept in their own hands was
continually diminishing, so that there was less and less use for the services of the
villeins, and commutation took place on a great scale. The landlords, who formerly
had taken the lead of agricultural operations, became now mere receivers of rent<a class="noteRef" id="n358.3src" href="#n358.3">156</a>.
</p>
<p>Now we must admit that commutation of labour dues for money payments was not possible
before money was used. Yet the fact that commutation of services for payments in kind,
which does not suppose money economy, also <span class="corr" id="xd32e18489" title="Source: occured">occurred</span><a class="noteRef" id="n358.4src" href="#n358.4">157</a>, shows that the rise of money economy cannot have been the sole cause of this change.
We may even go farther and say: if it has been a cause at all, it has not certainly
been one of the principal causes. The commutation of the labour dues means that the
demesne was thenceforth either worked with free labourers or let for rent. The existence
of a class of freemen dependent on wages cannot, however, be accounted for by <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>money economy. Nor can we see how money economy can have led to the letting of the
demesnes which the landlords had formerly kept in their own hands. Ochenkowski supposes
that in England, after the Norman Conquest, the need of the landlords for money led
to commutation<a class="noteRef" id="n359.1src" href="#n359.1">158</a>. But there is no reason why the landlords could not, instead of receiving money payments,
obtain money by selling the produce of their lands. As long as there was no market
for agricultural products the landlord, whether he himself had the lead of agricultural
operations or let the demesne on condition of receiving a payment in kind, could not
obtain money. As soon as there was a market he could make money in three ways: by
working the demesne himself and selling the produce, by letting it on condition of
receiving part of the produce, which he could bring to the market<a class="noteRef" id="n359.2src" href="#n359.2">159</a>, and by letting it for a rent in money. Money economy seems to have had little to
do with the commutation.
</p>
<p>Hildebrand’s theory is: money economy led to commutation and commutation led to freedom.
We have seen that the first half of this does not hold. What about the second half?
Can the commutation have loosened the ties which bound the cultivator to the soil?
We think not. For if the landlord could not let the villein who worked on the demesne
leave the manor, because he was difficult to replace, he had exactly the same reason
for keeping the villein who paid money astricted to the soil. The use of money and
the rise of commerce had not augmented the number of agricultural labourers; they
had even decreased, as many of them had gone to the towns. And it was even more difficult
to replace the money-paying than the labouring villein; for the former had to be a
fit person who could conduct his business well enough to be able at the end of the
year to furnish the required sum, whereas any able-bodied man could perform agricultural
labour under the supervision of the lord’s bailiff. Our conclusion is that money economy
did not lead to commutation, and that commutation did not lead to freedom.
</p>
<p>Yet money economy, taken in the sense of town life and <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>commerce, did sometimes affect the condition of the rural classes. Such was the case
in Italy where, in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, the wealthy commercial cities took an active part in the emancipation of
the serfs. Florence especially strongly encouraged their enfranchisement. In 1257
this city even went so far as to set free all the serfs in the surrounding country,
indemnifying the lords. The city government pretended to act from Christian and philanthropic
motives. “But” adds our informant “though the city governments of Central Italy were
the first to pronounce themselves in favour of the personal freedom of the peasants,
they by no means countenanced the idea of leaving the land to those who had held it
for centuries. On the contrary, the citizens endeavour to acquire landed properties,
and when they have got them they put an end to the hereditary tenures and replace
them by tenancies.” Many of the former serfs had to leave the lands of their ancestors
and augmented the number of proletarians in the towns. They were replaced by leaseholders<a class="noteRef" id="n360.1src" href="#n360.1">160</a>.
</p>
<p>The disappearance of serfdom was thus accelerated by the measures of the Italian cities.
How much of sentiment there was in these measures, and how much of self-interest,
we do not know. But at any rate serfdom must already have been drawing to an end before
the cities meddled with it. For a firmly established system that discharges an important
economic function is not uprooted by mere sentiment. And so far as the self-interest
of the citizens induced them to replace the serfs by free tenants, the latter system
must have been economically more useful than the former, which was probably only kept
up by the landlords because they were accustomed to it. Times had changed and the
old system of cultivation had become obsolete; and the citizens of the towns, whom
no personal relation bound to the serfs, expelled them and let the land to free tenants.
Before their intervention there must <span class="corr" id="xd32e18518" title="Source: adready">already</span> have been at work an internal cause, which effected that cultivation by serfs was
no longer the most profitable mode of managing landed properties.
</p>
<p>We do not mean to say that there was no internal connection <span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span>between the transition from serfdom to freedom and the simultaneous rise of town life,
commerce and manufactures. We think there was such a connection. But we cannot agree
with the theory that the disappearance of serfdom was a consequence of the commercial
development of Western Europe. It seems to us that the rise of commerce was not the
cause of the decline of serfdom, but that both were effects of the same principal
cause, the relative scarcity of land which made itself felt towards the end of the
Middle Ages. As soon as people had to shift on a limited area, the use of commerce,
which enables each district to produce what it is most fit to, and so enhances the
productiveness of labour, became more apparent than it had been at a time when there
was plenty of land. In the same sense, Malthus remarks: “The great cause which fills
towns and manufactories is an insufficiency of employment, and consequently the means
of support in the country; and if each labourer, in the parish where he was born,
could command food, clothing, and lodging for ten children, the population of the
towns would soon bear but a small proportion to the population of the country”<a class="noteRef" id="n361.1src" href="#n361.1">161</a>. Lange also says that poverty of the masses is a condition of the rise of manufactures<a class="noteRef" id="n361.2src" href="#n361.2">162</a>. Besides these economists, we may quote the eminent geographist Ratzel, who observes,
that in a country with a growing population the soil finally cannot any longer feed
the whole of the people and so an ever increasing part of the population devote themselves
to manufactures and commerce<a class="noteRef" id="n361.3src" href="#n361.3">163</a>. That this occurs even in primitive civilization, follows from what Krieger tells
us about the natives inhabiting the small islands adjoining New Guinea, especially
Berlin Harbour and Dallmann Harbour. The goad of necessity, he remarks, has urged
them to a progress in the arts of life. The want of room rendered extension of the
plantations on their islets impossible and so they began to manufacture carved work
and pottery, which they exported to the continent in exchange for food<a class="noteRef" id="n361.4src" href="#n361.4">164</a>.
</p>
<p>As for the medieval history of Europe, Inama-Sternegg observes that the increase of
the population, requiring an <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>extension of the means of subsistence, led to the rise of towns and manufactures<a class="noteRef" id="n362.1src" href="#n362.1">165</a>.
</p>
<p>But however this may be, we are certain that the rise of money economy cannot have
been the sole, or even the chief cause of the disappearance of servile labour. This
is sufficiently shown by the fact that before the emancipation of the Negroes a system
of servile labour on a large scale prevailed in the United States and the West Indies,
<i>i.e.</i> in countries working for export.
</p>
<p>Hildebrand’s theory has been accepted by some writers on economic history. Ochenkowski
repeatedly asserts that the change in the condition of the rural population was the
effect of money economy. Inama-Sternegg, in one passage of his excellent book on the
economic history of Germany, expresses the opinion that in the early Middle Ages natural
economy, defined by him as the absence of regular commercial intercourse, made astriction
of the labourers to the soil necessary. Professor Cunningham, in his book on Western
Civilization, ascribes the changes which in the history of ancient Greece and Rome
took place in the status of the labouring classes to the prevalence of natural economy
and money economy respectively<a class="noteRef" id="n362.2src" href="#n362.2">166</a>. But none of these writers give any new argument in favour of the theory.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the rise of money economy was not the cause of the disappearance
of serfdom. We shall inquire now whether Wakefield’s theory, with which we agree,
can further our understanding of the economic history of England and Germany.

<span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first detailed account of the economic condition of the country is contained in
Domesday Book, in which William of Normandy embodied the results of an inquiry into
the state of the kingdom he had secured.
</p>
<p>“When Domesday Survey was compiled” says Cunningham, “every yard of English soil was
as really, if not as definitely, subject to proprietary rights as it is now”<a class="noteRef" id="n363.1src" href="#n363.1">168</a>. We do not, however, think that much importance has to be attached to this statement;
for there was still much uncultivated land and, though the king claimed a right of
property over this land, it was not yet held as property in the strict sense of the
word, which means that all except the owner are excluded from its use. This appears
from what took place in 1305, under Edward I. “By an adjustment of boundaries considerable
portions of the Crown forest were given over to certain barons, who gained personally;
but the position of the tenants was so much altered for the worse that their case
obtained special attention in the <i>Ordinance of the Forest</i>, by which their rights of pasture and common were secured”<a class="noteRef" id="n363.2src" href="#n363.2">169</a>. We see that these Crown forests had been open to the use of the peasants, so that
practically there was still free land. And in this time of extensive tillage the common
pasture played a great part in the rural economy<a class="noteRef" id="n363.3src" href="#n363.3">170</a>.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, rent in the modern sense did not yet exist. The landlords had abundance
of land; but the land was worth little if it was not provided with people to cultivate
it. “The rent of the proprietor now is directly connected with the physical character
of his estate, its productiveness and its situation. The income of the lord of a Domesday
Manor depended on the tolls he received, and the payments of his dependents: and thus
was based on the way in which his estates were stocked with meat and men, rather than
on the physical condition of the land. His income was a very different thing from
modern rent”<a class="noteRef" id="n363.4src" href="#n363.4">171</a>. Even in later centuries “a fertile estate would have yielded but little annual income,
unless the necessary labour was attached to it”<a class="noteRef" id="n363.5src" href="#n363.5">172</a>.
</p>
<p>In this time the whole of Central England was covered with <span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>manors, and the mass of the rural population consisted of two classes: landlords and
villeins; the latter were not all of the same condition, but none of them enjoyed
entire personal freedom<a class="noteRef" id="n364.1src" href="#n364.1">173</a>. Of those cultivators who are described as <i>freemen</i> and <i>socmen</i> some could “sell their lands without leave asked or given, but others could only
do so on obtaining licence from the lord”<a class="noteRef" id="n364.2src" href="#n364.2">174</a>. Finally there were some slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n364.3src" href="#n364.3">175</a>. Every freeman was a landholder, therefore there was no class of free labourers.
“The labourer, as a man who depended on some employer for the opportunity and means
of doing his work, seems to have been almost unknown in the eleventh century”<a class="noteRef" id="n364.4src" href="#n364.4">176</a>.
</p>
<p>All this agrees with our theory. All land had not yet practically been appropriated;
therefore people could not be got to cultivate the land for the benefit of the landlords,
unless they were deprived of personal freedom.
</p>
<p>During the two following centuries population increased and land became more scarce.
In the 13<sup>th</sup> century some lords already began to inclose portions of the waste, which had always
been used for common pasturage, and “it was necessary to limit by the statute of Merton,
in 1236, the lord’s “right of approver” or improvement, by the condition that he should
not take away so much as not to leave enough for the purpose of pasture”<a class="noteRef" id="n364.5src" href="#n364.5">177</a>. Forests were often fenced off and the rights of common pasture restricted<a class="noteRef" id="n364.6src" href="#n364.6">178</a>. We have already mentioned an instance in which the condition of the peasants was
much altered for the worse by such measures.
</p>
<p>The changes which, during the same period, took place in the condition of the rural
classes, are grouped by Ashley under four heads: “1. the growth of a large class of
free tenants; 2. the commutation of the week work for money or corn payments; 3. the
commutation of the boon-days and other special services; and 4. the appearance of
a class of men dependent wholly or in part on the wages they received for agricultural
labour”<a class="noteRef" id="n364.7src" href="#n364.7">179</a>.
</p>
<p>In a passage quoted in the last paragraph Ashley states that <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>most of the “free tenants” were villeins who had commuted their labour services for
a money or corn payment, and had been freed from the more servile “incidents” of their
position, such as inability to sell a horse without the lord’s consent<a class="noteRef" id="n365.1src" href="#n365.1">180</a>. Hence it follows that personal freedom, <i>i.e.</i> the right to leave the manor, was not regarded as characteristic of free tenure.
Yet at the end of the 13<sup>th</sup> century every tenant was already permitted to sell his lands or parts of them<a class="noteRef" id="n365.2src" href="#n365.2">181</a>. This transition from personal to territorial obligations was certainly due to the
increase of population and consequent enhanced value of land. In early times labour
was scarce and therefore the landlord could not let a cultivator leave the manor.
But now land, or at least some pieces of land, had already acquired so much value
that there were always people to be found ready to cultivate them on condition of
paying certain dues to the lord.
</p>
<p>The principal cause of the commutation of labour dues for money was that the lord
let portions of the demesne instead of cultivating it through his bailiff or reeve.
He had now less need for the services of the villeins; for these services had consisted
mainly in working on the demesne<a class="noteRef" id="n365.3src" href="#n365.3">182</a>. This change in the mode of cultivation was perhaps due partly to political circumstances
(absence of the lord at court or in war), as in Germany it certainly was. But we think
there were economic causes also at work. In early times, when land was abundant, it
was necessary for the lord to keep the cultivators he wanted in personal subjection;
he therefore made them work in his presence and under the supervision of his bailiff.
But now the villeins had come to attach value to their holdings, they were no longer
inclined to run away, for it would have been difficult for them to find land to live
upon. The villein claimed an hereditary right to the land he cultivated, and the question
as to whether he had any such right already began to be discussed by the lawyers<a class="noteRef" id="n365.4src" href="#n365.4">183</a>.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 14<sup>th</sup> century most of the cultivators were still bound to the soil<a class="noteRef" id="n365.5src" href="#n365.5">184</a>, but the first germs of a thorough <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>change were already present. There were free tenants who could sell their lands; tenancies
at will already occurred, though not frequently<a class="noteRef" id="n366.1src" href="#n366.1">185</a>; and a class of free labourers arose. In Grossteste’s rules, dating from 1240 or
1241, it is said that servants and retainers “are to do what they are bid immediately
without any grumbling or contradiction; if they show any such disloyal spirit they
must be dismissed, for many can be had to fill their places”<a class="noteRef" id="n366.2src" href="#n366.2">186</a>. And there were also agricultural labourers who, though holding small pieces of land,
had not enough land to live upon, and were partially dependent on wages. Even where
the peasants were still obliged to cultivate the demesne, they did not usually perform
such work themselves, but hired labourers to do it; the usual phrase is that they
have to “find” a man for the work<a class="noteRef" id="n366.3src" href="#n366.3">187</a>.
</p>
<p>Here again our theory holds. Population had increased, land became scarce, and the
transition from serfdom to freedom commenced. If the population of England had continued
increasing, most of the villeins would probably have become freeholders or copyholders,
whereas the lands that the lords had kept in their own hands would have been leased.
And poor people who had neither land of their own nor capital enough to become farmers
would have served for wages.
</p>
<p>But an unexpected event entirely changed the economic condition of England. The Black
Death, which made its first appearance in 1349, swept away a large part of the population.
Whole villages were practically annihilated and large tracts of land went out of tillage.
The economic consequences were such as we should expect. “As one immediate result
there was great difficulty in getting labourers; the difficulty was aggravated in
those cases where the tenants had died off and the lords were left with large holdings
on their hands and no means of working them; while they lost the predial services
of these deceased tenants on the home farm. There was consequently an immensely increased
demand for hired labourers at the very time when their numbers were so much thinned,
and it seemed as if the agriculture of the country was completely <span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>ruined”<a class="noteRef" id="n367.1src" href="#n367.1">188</a>. Land was now again abundant, and so “instead of ousting tenants, lords of land found
it hard enough to retain them even with lightened services”<a class="noteRef" id="n367.2src" href="#n367.2">189</a>. And the natural consequence was that the landlords attempted to re-attach tenants
and labourers to the soil. Whether, as Professor Thorold Rogers asserts, the customary
tenants, who had commuted their labour dues for money, were forced back into the servile
position of their ancestors, is not certain<a class="noteRef" id="n367.3src" href="#n367.3">190</a>. At any rate “we may grant that, now that labour had become so costly, the lords
would insist on the exact performance of such labour dues as had not yet been commuted,
and on the punctual payment of all money rents. There is much reason to believe, moreover,
that they abused their power of imposing “amercements” on their tenants in the manor
courts for trivial breaches of duty”<a class="noteRef" id="n367.4src" href="#n367.4">191</a>. This severe and unaccustomed pressure on the villeins, who were becoming comfortable
copyholders, resulted in Wat Tyler’s revolt of 1381<a class="noteRef" id="n367.5src" href="#n367.5">192</a>.
</p>
<p>Nor were the labourers any longer allowed to dispose freely of their labour power.
“While the plague was actually raging parliament could not meet, but a proclamation
was at once issued by the king with the advice of certain prelates and nobles, of
which the preamble states that, “many seeing the necessity of masters and great scarcity
of servants will not serve unless they get excessive wages”, and that consequently
the land can be scarcely tilled. Everyone, free or villan, who can work and has no
other means of livelihood, is not to refuse to do so for anyone who offers the accustomed
wages; each lord is to have the preference in hiring the men on his own estate, but
none is to have too many men for his work; no labourer is to leave his employment
before the specified time; nor to receive more rations or wages than he did in the
twentieth year of the king and the common years before that; none are to give or take
more wages in town or country”<a class="noteRef" id="n367.6src" href="#n367.6">193</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>The depopulation of this time caused a reappearance of free land, <i>i.e.</i> of land which had practically no value, and so agricultural labourers were scarcely
to be had. Therefore the lords to some extent reattached the cultivators to the soil.
</p>
<p>These measures, however, were of little avail. It was not easy to prevent an employer
from secretly giving more than the statutory wages. The penalties for infraction of
the regulation were rendered more severe, the fines being replaced by imprisonment;
yet the whole legislation proved a failure<a class="noteRef" id="n368.1src" href="#n368.1">194</a>.
</p>
<p>And even if the statutes of labourers had been everywhere enforced, “many landowners
would have been left in a position of great difficulty; if there was no one to do
the work it did not much matter what they were to be paid, and in not a few villages
scarcely any one was left to carry on the ordinary agricultural operations.” Therefore
new expedients had to be devised, of which the most general appears to have been the
stock and land lease; “the new tenant took the land and the stock off the lord’s hands
and made in return a definite annual payment.” These tenants “probably sprang from
the class of free labourers, as the surviving <span class="corr" id="xd32e18726" title="Source: villans">villains</span> who already had their own holdings, would not be so easily able to offer for a portion
of the domain land which the lord desired to let”<a class="noteRef" id="n368.2src" href="#n368.2">195</a>.
</p>
<p>Here again we see the consequences of the abundance of land. The land alone could
not fetch a reasonable price; stock and land had to be leased together.
</p>
<p>As these leaseholders were taken from the labouring class, this measure, of course,
still further diminished the supply of labour.
</p>
<p>All these palliatives could not, indeed, better the <span class="corr" id="xd32e18736" title="Source: postion">position</span> of the landlords to any considerable extent. They had to wait for an increase of
population which would render to the land the value that it had before the Black Death.
As, however, the plague recurred several times, the population appears to have scarcely
increased<a class="noteRef" id="n368.3src" href="#n368.3">196</a>.
</p>
<p>The landlords remained in this difficult position till about 1450<a class="noteRef" id="n368.4src" href="#n368.4">197</a>, when a new and very efficacious remedy was suggested <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>to them: they applied a new mode of working their estates, which rendered them the
practical command over the land, without need of a denser population. The extension
of the wool trade and the dearth of labour made it far more profitable to keep large
flocks of sheep than to grow corn. Consequently much land was laid down in pasture;
there was a steady increase of sheep farming during the 15<sup>th</sup> century and a corresponding decrease of corn growing<a class="noteRef" id="n369.1src" href="#n369.1">198</a>.
</p>
<p>In our chapter on pastoral tribes it has been shown that the care of flocks and herds
does not require much labour. We can, therefore, easily understand that after the
rise of sheep farming there was far less need for agricultural labour than before.
There had been scarcity of labour; now there was over-population and many people were
thrown out of employment; for over-population exists, not only when there are more
people than the land can support, but when there are more people dependent on wages
than can be profitably employed by the owners of land and capital<a class="noteRef" id="n369.2src" href="#n369.2">199</a>.
</p>
<p>Sheep farming was introduced in the first place on the manorial demesnes, of which
the lords had the free disposal. The demesne usually formed from one-third to a half
of the whole arable area of a manor. Since the labour services of the villeins had
been commuted, the tillage of the demesne had furnished employment to many small tenants
and landless cottagers who, partly or entirely, depended on wages. The substitution
of pasture for tillage on the demesne, therefore, brought many of them to ruin; for
none but a few shepherds could thenceforth be employed<a class="noteRef" id="n369.3src" href="#n369.3">200</a>.
</p>
<p>But far graver evils resulted from the appropriation by the lords of the commons and
the land held by villeins or customary tenants.
</p>
<p>The commons, <i>i.e.</i> the common pasture and waste, had always been used jointly by the lord and villeins.
Whether the latter had any legal right to them is not certain; probably they had not;
but they had always been accustomed to have the <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>free use of them. Now the lords began to inclose large parts of these commons for
the formation of sheep runs. The consequence was that many of the customary tenants,
who had relied on the commons for pasturing their cattle, could no longer keep the
cattle necessary for the cultivation of their holding. Their farming became unprofitable,
and they had to leave their lands, which were instantly occupied by the lords and
laid down in pasture<a class="noteRef" id="n370.1src" href="#n370.1">201</a>.
</p>
<p>Even when the cultivator had not left his tenement, the lord sometimes appropriated
and “inclosed” it.
</p>
<p>The inclosures which took place, especially in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, are a fact of foremost importance in the history of English agriculture.
The term “inclosure” has two different meanings. In medieval England the lands of
the villeins, with those of the lord interspersed between them, lay scattered in a
number of acre or half-acre strips, no two strips held by one man being contiguous.
This system, dating from a time of extensive tillage, fell short of the exigencies
of advanced culture, and had to be removed before any improvement in the mode of cultivation
could be made. Therefore inclosures have often, especially in the reign of Elizabeth,
been made with the common consent of all the landholders concerned, the result being
that every tenant, instead of many scattered strips, obtained one or a few fields
lying together. “But in the earlier part of the same movement, during the period which
may be roughly defined as from 1450 to 1550, inclosure meant to a large extent the
actual dispossession of the customary tenants by their manorial lords. This took place
either in the form of the violent ousting of the sitting tenant, or of a refusal on
the death of one tenant to admit the son who in earlier centuries would have been
treated as his natural successor”<a class="noteRef" id="n370.2src" href="#n370.2">202</a>. It was this latter kind of inclosure that was condemned by several writers of the
16<sup>th</sup> century, for instance by Hales, who by inclosure did not mean “where a man doth enclose
and hedge in his own proper grounds where no man hath commons. For such enclosure
is very <span class="corr" id="xd32e18794" title="Source: benificial">beneficial</span> to the commonwealth; it is a cause of great encrease of wood; but it is meant thereby
when any man hath taken away and enclosed any other men’s commons, <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span>or hath pulled down houses of husbandry and converted the lands from tillage to pasture”<a class="noteRef" id="n371.1src" href="#n371.1">203</a>.
</p>
<p>Ashley, discussing the question as to whether the lords had a right to turn out the
villeins, arrives at the conclusion that “during historical times and until comparatively
modern days, the cultivators of the soil were always in a condition of dependence,
and held their lands at the arbitrary will of their lords. For centuries the lord
knew no other way of getting his land cultivated, and had no wish to get rid of a
tenant; whenever he did so, it was altogether exceptional. But with the tendency to
limitation and definition so characteristic of the feudal period, custom tended to
harden into law, and it would seem to have been on the point of becoming law when
a change in the economic situation,—the increasing advantage of pasture over tillage,—prompted
the lords to fall back on their old rights. Then followed a struggle between <i>a legal theory becoming obsolete</i>, but backed by the influence of the landowners, and <i>a custom on its way to become law</i>, backed by public sentiment and by the policy of the government”<a class="noteRef" id="n371.2src" href="#n371.2">204</a>.
</p>
<p>This is in perfect keeping with our theory. In former times land was abundant, and
therefore the lord “had no wish to get rid of a tenant,” for he “knew no other way
of getting his land cultivated”. But now sheep farming made appropriation of the whole
of the land possible, and so the lord was no longer in need of the villeins; he even
went so far as to evict those whom his ancestors had attached to the soil. And even
where the cultivators remained on the land, they often, and not always voluntarily,
became leaseholders instead of copyholders; and “in many cases a lease was but a stepping-stone
to tenure at will”<a class="noteRef" id="n371.3src" href="#n371.3">205</a>. The lords no longer contented themselves with the customary payments; instead of
villeins they wanted leaseholders, whose rents they could raise at the end of each
term, according as the value of the land had increased. “Rents were raised with great
rapidity as the tenant had to pay a sum equivalent to the utility of his holding as
part of a large pasture farm.”<a class="noteRef" id="n371.4src" href="#n371.4">206</a>.
</p>
<p>There was also far less need for agricultural labourers than <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>before. “The decay of tillage and lack of rural employment, during this century,”
says Professor Cunningham “rest on unimpeachable evidence”<a class="noteRef" id="n372.1src" href="#n372.1">207</a>. In the 14<sup>th</sup> century “the problem of the unemployed, as it now presents itself, had not yet arisen.”
But the agrarian changes “deprived great numbers of the agricultural labouring class,—small
customary tenants and cottagers,—of the means of support in their old places of abode,
and sent them wandering over the country”<a class="noteRef" id="n372.2src" href="#n372.2">208</a>.
</p>
<p>The appropriation of the whole of the land had thus given to the rural economy of
England a new and essentially modern character: there were now leaseholders and tenants
at will, labouring poor and unemployed. And the ancient institution of serfdom could
not hold its own in the presence of such thorough changes. “The slow agricultural
revolution which rendered their services less useful to the manorial lords, gradually
set the villans free by removing the interest their masters had in retaining a hold
upon them.” “In some instances the exaction of predial services from villans by manorial
lords can be traced as late as the time of Elizabeth; but though no change was made
in the law, the lords seem to have found that it was not worth their while to assert
their rights over the persons of their bondmen”<a class="noteRef" id="n372.3src" href="#n372.3">209</a>.
</p>
<p>There were, however, many parts of England in which scarcely any inclosures took place<a class="noteRef" id="n372.4src" href="#n372.4">210</a>. Here the villeins remained on their lands and gradually became copyholders. They
were still bound to services, which, however, were generally commuted for small money
payments, so the conditions of their tenure were annoying rather than oppressive.
Moreover, their obligations were no longer personal, but territorial; they were not
astricted to the soil. And as they had an hereditary right to their holdings, they
differed but little from freeholders. The “innocuous curiosities of copyhold,” survivals
of ancient serfdom, have lasted up to modern times<a class="noteRef" id="n372.5src" href="#n372.5">211</a>.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Our theory can thus be of much use in accounting for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb373">[<a href="#pb373">373</a>]</span>changes which have taken place in the rural economy of England. As long as there was
still free land, <i>i.e.</i> land which, though sometimes claimed by an owner, could not fetch any reasonable
price, the cultivators were astricted to the soil; but as soon as the proprietors
had got the practical command over the whole of the land, many of the villeins were
evicted and replaced by leaseholders or tenants at will or became such themselves;
and the remainder became copyholders, <i>i.e.</i> proprietors obliged to some services or payments without being personally unfree.
</p>
<p>We shall inquire now whether in Germany too the appropriation of the whole of the
land coincided with the transition from serfdom to freedom.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the time of the Merovingians the greater part of the country was covered with forests
and people relied on the products of the forests for a considerable portion of their
subsistence. Land was abundant, and even the cultivated land had hardly any exchange
value<a class="noteRef" id="n373.1src" href="#n373.1">212</a>.
</p>
<p>Much new land was, however, already being taken into cultivation. The village communities,
consisting of free peasants, as well as separate members of these communities, cleared
considerable portions of the waste land lying round the villages. In the 8<sup>th</sup> century some communities already forbade individuals to reclaim land; but this was
still of rare occurrence; generally speaking the waste could be appropriated by whoever
chose to take it into cultivation<a class="noteRef" id="n373.2src" href="#n373.2">213</a>.
</p>
<p>The bulk of the population consisted of free peasants. There were two unfree classes:
slaves and <i>lites</i> (a kind of serfs); but these were not numerous<a class="noteRef" id="n373.3src" href="#n373.3">214</a>.
</p>
<p>The free peasant, though he had plenty of land, was rather poorly off; he had no slaves
and so could only dispose of the labour power of himself and his family; and in this
<span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>time of extensive tillage the produce of each man’s labour was small<a class="noteRef" id="n374.1src" href="#n374.1">215</a>.
</p>
<p>Great proprietors were still rare. They worked their own lands with slaves. Sometimes,
however, they gave pieces of land in use, generally to slaves; for, says our informant,
the free peasants did not like to take the land of the nobles and so make themselves
dependent on them<a class="noteRef" id="n374.2src" href="#n374.2">216</a>. And when land was given in use to free peasants (especially by the church) this
was done on very advantageous terms, often at a nominal rent<a class="noteRef" id="n374.3src" href="#n374.3">217</a>.
</p>
<p>Land was thus abundant, slavery existed, and tenant farmers and free labourers were
absent.
</p>
<p>In the Carolingian period the clearing of forests went on continually. Some land was
still reclaimed by free peasants, but much more by the great proprietors who controlled
abundant labour forces<a class="noteRef" id="n374.4src" href="#n374.4">218</a>. The lords were already beginning to claim much uncultivated land, the reclaiming
of which they only allowed on condition of the cultivator subjecting himself to them.
There was far less unappropriated land than in the foregoing period, and such as there
was was claimed by the king<a class="noteRef" id="n374.5src" href="#n374.5">219</a>. Yet we cannot speak of an appropriation of the whole of the land; for we know that
a claim of the king to large tracts of uninhabited land is practically of little consequence.
Accordingly our informant states that land was still abundant. The free peasants were
already in a difficult position, not, however, because land was scarce, but because
they could not provide the labour necessary to convert woods and marshes into arable
land<a class="noteRef" id="n374.6src" href="#n374.6">220</a>.
</p>
<p>In this period the free peasants began to be absorbed by the great proprietors. The
latter wanted labourers and did their utmost to astrict the common freemen to their
estates. Many people placed themselves under the protection of nobles; others, being
reduced to poverty (especially through the institution of the <i>wergild</i>, and the compulsory military service which interfered with the cultivation of the
land) fell into the hands of the lords; and some were straightway made serfs by violence.
As the landlords had the right of jurisdiction and <span class="pageNum" id="pb375">[<a href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>other public rights, they could easily subject the small landholders under some pretext
or even without any. Former free peasants, <i>lites</i>, and such slaves as had received a piece of land in use, though designated by different
names, came to form practically one class, the labouring as opposed to the ruling
class<a class="noteRef" id="n375.1src" href="#n375.1">221</a>. A manorial organization arose similar to that which existed in England. There were
some slaves for personal service and agricultural labour and a great number of dependent
peasants of various kinds, who had to cultivate the demesne of the lord and yield
him part of the produce of their own holdings<a class="noteRef" id="n375.2src" href="#n375.2">222</a>.
</p>
<p>Free labourers were found rarely if at all<a class="noteRef" id="n375.3src" href="#n375.3">223</a>.
</p>
<p>Our informant in several passages speaks of freemen destitute of land<a class="noteRef" id="n375.4src" href="#n375.4">224</a>. But these people are not in any way to be identified with the poor of modern times
who depend on wages. They were generally foreigners who had no rights in any village
community; but the lords were always ready to receive them and give them a piece of
land in use on condition of their rendering services and paying tributes. The natural
increase of the labouring population and immigration of foreign labour did not yet
cause any difficulty<a class="noteRef" id="n375.5src" href="#n375.5">225</a>.
</p>
<p>Most of the cultivators of this time had not the right of leaving the manors to which
their holdings belonged<a class="noteRef" id="n375.6src" href="#n375.6">226</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that in this period there was still much free land; slavery existed and serfdom
was on the increase; leaseholders, tenants at will and free labourers were wanting.
All this agrees with our theory.
</p>
<p>In the next period colonization and reclaiming of waste land went on on a large scale.
But at the same time the population increased and the value of the land increased
with it. Lamprecht, speaking of the 13<sup>th</sup> century, writes: “Colonization and reclaiming of land had entirely changed the condition
of the rural population between the 10<sup>th</sup> and the 13<sup>th</sup> century. In the time of the Carolingians wood and land had <span class="pageNum" id="pb376">[<a href="#pb376">376</a>]</span>still been regarded as inexhaustible goods of the nation, like the sun, air and water;
but now the limitations of the geographical basis of national life appeared more and
more clearly. There had been an immense range of land to grow food upon; but now the
supply of land became limited, chiefly and first on the Rhine, in Suabia and Franconia,
afterwards in Saxony, and finally in Bavaria, the Tyrol, and Styria; people had to
shift on a limited area. The soil became, more than before, an object of economic
value; its price kept continually increasing. In the 12<sup>th</sup> century, in some prosperous districts, land seems to have attained twelve times the
value it had in the 9<sup>th</sup>; and even afterwards, down to the second half of the 13<sup>th</sup> century, an increase of about 50 per cent. is to be observed. Taking into consideration
that land was still regarded, especially by the ruling classes, as the only basis
of social and political influence (though already other sources of large incomes were
gradually arising), we may understand how intense the struggle for the possession
of the soil must have been at this period”<a class="noteRef" id="n376.1src" href="#n376.1">227</a>.
</p>
<p>The right of the king to unappropriated land was now enforced more strictly than before,
and the lords began to claim a right of property over the commons surrounding the
villages, which, however, were often still left to the use of the peasants<a class="noteRef" id="n376.2src" href="#n376.2">228</a>.
</p>
<p>However, there was no over-population as yet. The proprietors did their best to attract
people to the vast newly colonized districts, especially to the eastern parts of Germany<a class="noteRef" id="n376.3src" href="#n376.3">229</a>.
</p>
<p>During the whole of this period the landlords went on subjugating the rural population,
so that at the end of it the peasant proprietors, who had once formed the bulk of
the population, had almost entirely disappeared, and most of the land was taken up
with the estates of the great proprietors<a class="noteRef" id="n376.4src" href="#n376.4">230</a>.
</p>
<p>But the increase in the value of land already made itself <span class="pageNum" id="pb377">[<a href="#pb377">377</a>]</span>felt in the way in which the lords managed their estates. They less and less frequently
worked their own lands; their chief aim was no longer the disposal of the labour of
their dependents, but the receiving of rent. The labour dues were often commuted for
money payments<a class="noteRef" id="n377.1src" href="#n377.1">231</a>.
</p>
<p>Labour was not worth so much to the lords as it had been. They sometimes emancipated
their slaves, retaining the land which they had given them in use<a class="noteRef" id="n377.2src" href="#n377.2">232</a>.
</p>
<p>At the same time a class of free tenants arose. Lamprecht remarks that while the value
of land had considerably increased the tributes which the villeins had to pay had
remained unchanged for several centuries. In an economic sense the landlords had been
dispossessed of a large proportion of their property in the land. Therefore it was
not their interest to let serfdom continue.
</p>
<p>“At this time, <span class="corr" id="xd32e19015" title="Source: especialy">especially</span> since the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century, the villeins and landlords of the most progressive districts settled their
mutual relations by free contract. Serfdom was abolished, sometimes entirely, sometimes
for the greater part, some formalities only subsisting. The former villein acquired
the right to emigrate, and remained as a free tenant on the land he had till then
occupied. Thus, by leasing his lands for terms of years, and sometimes for life or
on hereditary tenancy, the landlord got back the full rent of his property; and this
system, especially the lease for years, enabled him to raise the rent at the end of
each term, according as the value of the land had increased in the meantime”<a class="noteRef" id="n377.3src" href="#n377.3">233</a>.
</p>
<p>Inama-Sternegg does not quite agree with this view of Lamprecht’s. Even where the
rent was higher than the former customary payment, he says, the leaseholder was free
from the labour dues and additional payments to which the villein had been bound,
so the transition from fixed payment to rent did not always mean an enhancement of
the obligation of the peasant<a class="noteRef" id="n377.4src" href="#n377.4">234</a>. Yet this writer too states that the leasing of land became more and more frequent.
There were free contracts between proprietor and tenant, which did not interfere with
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb378">[<a href="#pb378">378</a>]</span>personal liberty of the latter; even non-fulfilment of his obligations by the tenant
had only pecuniary consequences<a class="noteRef" id="n378.1src" href="#n378.1">235</a>.
</p>
<p>We cannot but think that the reason given by Lamprecht for the transition from servile
to free tenure is true. For even when the original rent was not higher than the former
customary payment plus the value of the labour dues, the possibility of raising the
rent after each term remained.
</p>
<p>We hear of free tenants in this period, but not yet of free labourers. This is exactly
what our theory teaches us to expect. Land, in some parts of Germany, had already
acquired a high value; such land must have been very <span class="corr" id="xd32e19038" title="Source: renumerative">remunerative</span>, and so people were ready to pay a rent for its use, even though there was still
land to be had gratis or at a nominal rent, but far from the market and therefore
less profitable. But the country was not yet so densely peopled that there were men
who could not secure the use of any piece of land; therefore a class of people dependent
on wages did not yet exist.
</p>
<p>In the 13<sup>th</sup> century much new land was still taken into cultivation, in Western as well as Eastern
Germany; but in the following centuries very little land was added to the arable area.
The woods, which had formerly been regarded as inexhaustible, were no longer present
in great abundance, and the rulers of the German states as well as the landlords exerted
themselves to preserve the remainder and forbade the peasants to clear them. From
the middle of the 14<sup>th</sup> century these prohibitive measures became general<a class="noteRef" id="n378.2src" href="#n378.2">236</a>.
</p>
<p>As the population continued to increase, land became scarce. In many parts of Southern
and Western Germany the lords parcelled out their lands in small portions, and farms
of the size which had been customary for centuries became rare<a class="noteRef" id="n378.3src" href="#n378.3">237</a>.
</p>
<p>The rights of the peasants to the use of the commons, on which they had always relied
for a considerable portion of their subsistence, were now restricted, and the lords
asserted their claims to the commons more strictly than before<a class="noteRef" id="n378.4src" href="#n378.4">238</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb379">[<a href="#pb379">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another consequence of the increase of population was that cattle-keeping was no longer
possible on such a large scale as formerly when the common pasture occupied a great
part of the land. At the end of the Middle Ages there was a scarcity of meat, and
people had to rely, more than before, on vegetable food<a class="noteRef" id="n379.1src" href="#n379.1">239</a>.
</p>
<p>The need of the landlords for the services of the peasants went on diminishing. They
no longer worked their own estates; nearly the whole of their income consisted of
the payments in kind and in money which they received from their dependents<a class="noteRef" id="n379.2src" href="#n379.2">240</a>.
</p>
<p>In Lower Saxony and part of Westphalia the lords, as early as the 13<sup>th</sup> century, emancipated considerable numbers of villeins in their own interest. For
the villeins had gradually acquired some right to their holdings, and the landlords,
by setting them free, got back the free disposal of the land, which they thenceforth
let out to free tenants<a class="noteRef" id="n379.3src" href="#n379.3">241</a>.
</p>
<p>In the 14<sup>th</sup> century the lords began to turn out peasants (<i lang="de">Bauernlegen</i>) and lease the land of which they thus re-acquired the free disposal<a class="noteRef" id="n379.4src" href="#n379.4">242</a>.
</p>
<p>Free tenancies became now general, parts of the demesne, as well as lands which had
been held in servile tenure, being leased. The increased demand for land enabled the
lords to let small allotments at extravagant prices<a class="noteRef" id="n379.5src" href="#n379.5">243</a>.
</p>
<p>Even where the customary tenures remained, the obligations of the peasants, which
had been personal, in many cases became territorial, the holder of the land as such
being subject to payments. And the conditions of this tenure were so little servile
that sometimes nobles and knights received such land in use and took the obligations
on themselves<a class="noteRef" id="n379.6src" href="#n379.6">244</a>.
</p>
<p>The difference between farmers and agricultural labourers now first came into existence.
The latter most often held a small patch of land, but this was not sufficient to live
upon; they depended on wages. Besides agricultural labourers there were male and female
servants for household labour. The regulation <span class="pageNum" id="pb380">[<a href="#pb380">380</a>]</span>of wages by law, which occurred especially after the ravages of the great plague,
proves that in the southern and western parts of Germany free labour had become general.
Such servile work as still remained was often done by labourers hired by the peasant
to whose duty the work fell, just as in the case of the English peasant who “found”
a man<a class="noteRef" id="n380.1src" href="#n380.1">245</a>.
</p>
<p>All land was now held as property; consequently the land was more and more held by
free tenants and worked with free labourers dependent on wages, whereas serfdom gradually
died out.
</p>
<p>In the 15<sup>th</sup> century, however, according to both Lamprecht and Inama-Sternegg, serfdom and even
slavery reappeared.
</p>
<p>Lamprecht, after speaking of the raising of rents by the landlords, adds: “But more
disastrous in its consequences than all this was the manner in which the landlords
dealt with the increasing surplus population of the farms occupied by their villeins.
Formerly, younger sons of villeins, as well as children of free parents, had removed
to the woods for the purpose of clearing them; and it was with their help that the
landlords had in the course of the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries extended their landed properties. In later times such younger sons had
often gone to the towns or the newly colonized districts of Eastern Germany. Now there
was a stagnation among them as well as among the small remainder of the free population.
There remained no other alternative but to divide the farms of the villeins. But the
interest of the landlord was opposed to this. He had no security of receiving rent
and services from farms parcelled out into small allotments. Therefore he did not,
as a rule, divide the farms into more than four parts; and those of the servile population
who could not secure the use of such a small holding were regarded as slaves. This
institution, the origin of which went back to the first half of the 12<sup>th</sup> century, had till then been almost entirely foreign to the development of Germany.
Together with a rural proletariat destitute of nearly everything, a real slavery came
now for the first time into existence on German ground.… And this new slave class
went on continually <span class="pageNum" id="pb381">[<a href="#pb381">381</a>]</span>increasing; in the first half of the 15<sup>th</sup> century they already formed a considerable number, about whose fate patriots were
very uneasy.… Nor did the evil stop here. The term slavery, used first with regard
to villeins who occupied no farm, was soon applied to all villeins, in order to tax
them more and more heavily and dispute their right of succeeding to the farms of their
parents, which had been established at least since the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Finally the landlords came to regard even free tenants as slaves and slavery
as the only status of the rural population”<a class="noteRef" id="n381.1src" href="#n381.1">246</a>.
</p>
<p>We can easily understand that the lords designated these proletarians by the most
contemptuous name they could devise. But were they really slaves? A slave, as opposed
to a free labourer, is not allowed to leave his master. Now it is remarkable that
Inama-Sternegg, describing the condition of the rural population in the different
states of Germany, though he states that in the newly colonized eastern parts of Germany
the peasants, who had been free, were restricted in their right of leaving their lords,
mentions no such particulars of Western Germany<a class="noteRef" id="n381.2src" href="#n381.2">247</a>. And the chief aim of the peasants, in their revolts at the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> century, was not to acquire personal freedom, but to retain the use of the commons,
which the lords were appropriating<a class="noteRef" id="n381.3src" href="#n381.3">248</a>.
</p>
<p>The peasants were, indeed, obliged to more services in the 15<sup>th</sup> than in the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries. But we cannot regard this as a mark of returning serfdom or slavery; for
Inama-Sternegg explicitly states that the greater oppression of the rural classes
in the 15<sup>th</sup> century was chiefly due to the increase of the services required by the rulers of
the several German states. The services exacted by the landlords had rather diminished<a class="noteRef" id="n381.4src" href="#n381.4">249</a>.
</p>
<p>The same writer, recapitulating his conclusions as to the condition of the rural population
at the end of the Middle Ages, begins by saying that the cultivators, who formerly
had had an hereditary right to the land on condition of paying a fixed sum, were now
far more heavily taxed and had little security <span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>of remaining on the land<a class="noteRef" id="n382.1src" href="#n382.1">250</a>. We think that this is what the statements of our informants about the reappearance
of slavery mean. The cultivators were not slaves, but impoverished and despised tenants
at will and agricultural labourers.
</p>
<p>At any rate, in the 16<sup>th</sup> century eviction of peasants, which is the reverse of astriction to the soil, became
of frequent occurrence. Ashley, who has consulted some of the best literature, states
that “the Bavarian code of 1518 laid down that the peasant had no hereditary right
to his holding, and not even a life interest unless he could show some documentary
evidence. In Mecklenburg a decree of 1606 declared that the peasants were not <i lang="la">emphyteutae</i> but <i lang="la">coloni</i>, whom their lords could compel to give up the lands allotted to them, and who could
claim no right of inheritance even when their ancestors had held the land from time
immemorial. In Holstein, again, a great number of the peasants were expelled from
their holdings, and such as remained became tenants at will”<a class="noteRef" id="n382.2src" href="#n382.2">251</a>.
</p>
<p>Serfdom, in Southern and Western Germany, thus died out towards the end of the Middle
Ages, at a time when population had become numerous and land scarce.
</p>
<p>The eastern parts of Germany had quite another agrarian history. Here serfdom was
not common before the 16<sup>th</sup> century. From this time, however, and especially after the Thirty Years’ War, it
became more and more general. As this is quite a separate history we shall not speak
of it any further<a class="noteRef" id="n382.3src" href="#n382.3">252</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb383a">[<a href="#pb383a">383</a>]</span></p>
<p>We think the above remarks on England and the older parts of Germany may suffice to
show that our theory can throw some light on the agrarian history of Western Europe.
</p>
<p>We are fully aware that the condition of the rural classes must have been determined
by many more circumstances of greater and lesser importance. But it seems to us that
the general cause of which we have spoken in these paragraphs is second to no other
in its operation<a class="noteRef" id="n383.1src" href="#n383.1">253</a>.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have said that among agricultural peoples slavery, as an industrial system, only
exists where there is still free land; it disappears as soon as all land has been
<span class="corr" id="xd32e19265" title="Source: appropiated">appropriated</span>. We have also seen that slavery does not prevail to any considerable extent where
subsistence is dependent on capital<a class="noteRef" id="n383.2src" href="#n383.2">254</a>. We may <span class="pageNum" id="pb384a">[<a href="#pb384a">384</a>]</span>now combine these two conclusions into this general rule: <i>slavery, as an industrial system, is not likely to exist where subsistence depends
on material resources which are present in limited quantity</i>.
</p>
<p>A tribe or nation cannot subsist without labour (though the amount of labour required
is sometimes small); but, besides this, material resources are always necessary. The
resources which man uses to procure his subsistence are of two kinds: gifts of nature,
and products of human labour. The latter are commonly termed capital; their supply
is always limited. Most of the former (air, water, the heat of the sun, etc.) exist
in unlimited quantity, <i>i.e.</i> there is so much of them that nobody wants to appropriate them. Land is also a gift
of nature, and in some very thinly peopled countries, where there is much more fertile
ground than can be cultivated, it has not any more value than air and water. But as
all land has not the same properties, it soon comes to pass that the most fertile
and most favourably situated land is appropriated by some men to the exclusion of
others. This is the origin of rent. Finally, when the less valuable grounds have also
been appropriated, free land no longer exists; there is no piece of land but has its
definite owner<a class="noteRef" id="n384.1src" href="#n384.1">255</a>. This last state of things has social consequences very similar to those which exist
where subsistence depends on capital. In both cases indispensable means of production
are in the hands of definite persons; therefore a man destitute either of land or
of capital (according as subsistence depends on the former or the latter), cannot
subsist independently of the owners, but has to apply to them for employment. Moreover,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span>in both cases more than a limited quantity of labour cannot be profitably employed:
the owner of capital, or of a limited space of land, cannot derive any profit from
employing more than a certain number of labourers. Therefore in either case slavery,
as an industrial system, is not likely to exist.
</p>
<p>These considerations lead us to an important conclusion. All the peoples of the earth,
whether they subsist by hunting, fishing, cattle-breeding, agriculture, trade or manufactures,
may be divided into two categories. Among the peoples of the first category the means
of subsistence are open to all; every one who is able-bodied and not defective in
mind can provide for himself independently of any capitalist or landlord. Among some
of these peoples capital is of some use, and some valuable lands are already held
as property; but those who are destitute of such advantages can perfectly well do
without them, for there are still abundant natural supplies open to them. Among the
peoples of the other category subsistence depends on resources of which the supply
is limited, and therefore people destitute of these resources are dependent on the
owners. It may be convenient to suggest technical names for these two categories.
We shall speak of <i>peoples with open resources</i> and <i>peoples with closed resources</i>. We think the meaning of these terms is clear, and they may be convenient for use.
The distinction is an important one. We suppose we have sufficiently proved that the
relations between the social classes differ largely, according as resources are open
or closed: only among peoples with open resources can slavery and serfdom exist, whereas
free labourers dependent on wages are only found among peoples with closed resources<a class="noteRef" id="n385.1src" href="#n385.1">256</a>. Our distinction may prove valuable in other respects also, <i>e.g.</i> over-population and lack of employment are unknown among peoples with open resources;
war, which, when resources are open, has sometimes rather the character of a sport,
becomes more serious when resources have become closed, for then its object is to
extend the supply <span class="pageNum" id="pb386">[<a href="#pb386">386</a>]</span>of land or capital at the cost of the enemy<a class="noteRef" id="n386.1src" href="#n386.1">257</a>; pessimism is more likely to prevail among peoples with closed than among peoples
with open resources, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="n386.2src" href="#n386.2">258</a>. We shall not, however, enlarge upon these points any further.
</p>
<p>Most savage tribes have open resources. All hunters have (with the exception, perhaps,
of some Australians): neither the game nor the hunting territories are held as property.
Further, most fishers: fishing is carried on in a simple manner and does not yet require
capital. And finally, most agricultural tribes; among them <i lang="la">superest ager</i>, as Tacitus says of the ancient Germans<a class="noteRef" id="n386.3src" href="#n386.3">259</a>.
</p>
<p>Savage tribes with closed resources are: 1º possibly some Australian hunters, if it
is true that among them every inch of ground is held as property, 2º the Eskimos (fishers),
who cannot get on without a boat, or a sledge and dogs, 3º all pastoral tribes, 4º
the agricultural tribes inhabiting most of the Polynesian and Micronesian islands,
the Fijians and perhaps a few agricultural tribes outside Oceania.
</p>
<p>We shall not inquire whether the civilized nations of ancient and modern times have,
or had, open or closed resources. We will only remark that in Western Europe resources,
from open, have become closed. Yet they are not altogether closed, as long as there
are still thinly peopled countries open for emigration. Whether the white races will
still have room for expansion for a considerable time, we cannot know.
</p>
<p>When we were preparing the first edition of this work, we thought the distinction
between countries with open and with closed resources had not been made before. Since
we read Lange’s book on the labour problem and saw that the author speaks in the same
sense of open and closed countries or open and closed economy. We give here the passages
of most interest, bearing on the subject. “There is a great difference between <span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span>the economy of open and closed civilized countries. In the former there is still an
abundance of land fit for cultivation, of which every labourer has the free use; in
the latter all land has been taken into cultivation and appropriated. This difference
is so fundamental, that it would be best to formulate a separate economic theory for
either of the two cases and then, in applying the theory to the facts, to examine
how far, in every instance, the characteristics of open or closed economy are present.
The latter proceeding is always necessary, for the important distinction we have made
is a relative one, no country presenting exclusively the conditions of either open
or closed culture.” In another chapter the author dwells more at length on the idea,
laid down in the last sentence. “The earth still contains large territories, not yet
taken into cultivation, which in a certain sense are open to every one; but there
are such factors as habits, prejudices, etc., which bind people to their own country,
and there are further material impediments to emigration from old civilized countries,
which are so great, that the economy of such countries may practically be regarded
as closed, without being such in an absolute sense. On the other hand, even in the
most open colonial country there are always circumstances which make the occupation
of uncultivated land difficult and so the economy of such a country presents some
characteristics of a closed economy. Between these two types there are numberless
intermediate stages and therefore economic life is in reality subject to the influences
of both open and closed economy. But in theory a sharp line of demarcation must be
drawn between these two states of society; for only so can we attain to a right understanding
of real economic life”<a class="noteRef" id="n387.1src" href="#n387.1">260</a>.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs we shall speak of the effect of secondary causes among
agricultural tribes. We shall not, however, enter into many details. The difficulty,
in our branch of science, is always, that we have so few works of predecessors to
rely upon. For instance, we shall speak of the influence of trade among agricultural
tribes. Now, if any accurate researches <span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>had been made into the general effects of trade, we should be able to conclude that
trade having been proved to have such general effects, it must have such an influence
on slavery. But as such is not the case, we should be obliged, if we were thoroughly
to investigate the subject, to inquire what are the general effects of trade. An equally
close study of militarism, of the condition of women, etc., would be required. And
as in this way our book would never come to an end, we shall content ourselves with
giving a few outlines, which we hope may turn the attention of other ethnologists
to the important problems which the ensuing paragraphs will contain.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 13.</span> <i>Condition of women.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As we have remarked before, the position held by the women of a tribe determines to
some extent whether or not slaves are wanted. Where all the drudgery is performed,
and can be performed, by the women, and the men do not want to relieve them of it,
there is no great use for slave labour. But where women enjoy high consideration,
the men are more likely to procure slaves who are to assist the women in their work.
</p>
<p>We shall speak first of the latter fact, of slaves performing female labour. It is
very often stated that slaves are employed for domestic labour. And as, in countries
where slavery does not exist, domestic labour is nearly always incumbent on the women,
slaves who perform such work alleviate the women’s task. Where slavery prevails to
a great extent it even occurs that slave-owners, female as well as male, have scarcely
anything to do, all work falling to the share of the slaves. The slave-owners, in
such case, form the aristocracy; the slaves, and the poor freemen unable to purchase
slaves, are the labouring classes. We may remind the reader of ancient Rome, where
the domestic slaves, the <i lang="la">familia urbana</i>, performed all domestic services required by the rich, and of the women of the upper
classes in Mohammedan countries, who spend their time in idleness in the harems.
</p>
<p>We have seen that among some pastoral tribes domestic labour is the chief occupation
of the slaves. We do not recollect <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>having found any instance of a similar state of things among any agricultural tribe,
and cannot think that such will anywhere be the case. A rich cattle-keeper can easily
support, by the produce of his cattle, some domestic slaves who perform no productive
labour. But among agricultural tribes it is otherwise: subsistence here depends almost
entirely on labour; therefore slaves performing unproductive labour can only be kept
if there are other slaves who till the soil and procure food for the family. It is
not probable that the master will himself undertake the cultivation required to feed
the slaves who assist his wife in her work; nor would the wife be glad to receive
slaves from her husband, if she had to provide for them by working on the field. The
Romans would not have kept a <i lang="la">familia urbana</i>, if there had not also been a <i lang="la">familia rustica</i>.
</p>
<p>Hitherto we have spoken of unproductive female labour. But women, in primitive agricultural
societies, often perform productive labour also: in many cases the tilling of the
soil is incumbent on them. We may suppose that the introduction of slaves has often
served to free the women from this task. We shall not, however, proceed to a closer
examination of this point; for this would require a digression on the division of
labour between the sexes, which falls beyond the scope of the present volume.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the place of slaves is often supplied by wives. We have seen that
among the Australian hunters polygamy widely prevails and serves economic purposes.
The same is the case among some agricultural tribes.
</p>
<p>In § 8 the non-existence of slavery in most of the Melanesian islands has been left
unexplained. We shall see now that in several of these islands a “slavery of women”
prevails which bears much resemblance to slavery proper. Purchase of wives is in vogue;
and most of the women are bought by the rich, many of whom possess a large number
of wives. And the women must work hard to increase the income of their owners<a class="noteRef" id="n389.1src" href="#n389.1">261</a>.
</p>
<p>Guppy, in his description of the Solomon Islands, states: “The powerful chiefs of
the islands of Bougainville Straits <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>usually possess a large number of wives of whom only the few that retain their youth
and comeliness enjoy much of the society of their lord. The majority, having been
supplanted in the esteem of their common husband, have sunk into a condition of drudgery,
finding their employment and their livelihood in toiling for the master whose affections
they once possessed. I learned from Gorai, the Shortland chief, who has between eighty
and a hundred wives, that the main objection he has against missionaries settling
on his islands is, that they would insist on his giving up nearly all his wives, thereby
depriving him of those by whose labour his plantations are cultivated and his household
supplied with food. A great chief, he remarked, required a large staff of workers
to cultivate his extensive lands, or, in other words, numerous women to work in his
plantations and to bring the produce home”<a class="noteRef" id="n390.1src" href="#n390.1">262</a>.
</p>
<p>This statement is very remarkable. In the second chapter of Part I we have seen that
in these same islands of Bougainville Straits boys are captured from the neighbouring
islands. Guppy calls them slaves, but at the same time tells us that they “enjoy most
of the rights of a native of the common class”<a class="noteRef" id="n390.2src" href="#n390.2">263</a>. There is thus no difficulty in obtaining slaves; yet slavery is little developed,
for the simple reason that polygamy perfectly serves the purposes of slavery.
</p>
<p>Ribbe equally remarks that on Bougainville polygamy is common. The wife is the slave
of her husband: she has to till the fields, to perform most of the domestic work and
to take care of the children. In the Shortland Islands (near Bougainville) the wife
is the slave and beast of burden of her husband, rather than his companion<a class="noteRef" id="n390.3src" href="#n390.3">264</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Nissan Islands, according to Sorge, most of the work is done by the women<a class="noteRef" id="n390.4src" href="#n390.4">265</a>.
</p>
<p>In the New Hebrides polygamy also prevails. The price paid for a wife varies from
10 <span class="corr" id="xd32e19399" title="Source: tot">to</span> 20 pigs, “according to her capabilities as a worker in the yam-patch.” “They [the
women] learn in their girlhood all that fits them to be man’s slave and <span class="pageNum" id="pb391">[<a href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>toiler in the fields”. “Women are degraded to the level of brute beasts, doing all
the hard field work, and being made to carry loads which appear quite disproportionate
to their ugly-shaped bodies and thin legs”<a class="noteRef" id="n391.1src" href="#n391.1">266</a>. Hagen and Pineau give a similar account of female labour, and add that a man’s wealth
depends on the number of his wives<a class="noteRef" id="n391.2src" href="#n391.2">267</a>.
</p>
<p>De Vaux, speaking of the women of New Caledonia, says: “All the drudgery is incumbent
on them. They perform the clearing and digging of the soil, carry on their backs crushing
loads of ignames and taros to the village, and, if a chief has promised you assistance
in some fatiguing work that you want to have quickly done, he will send you a gang
of these miserable beings who may scarcely be called women.” Turner remarks: “Chiefs
had ten, twenty, and thirty wives. The more wives the better plantations and the more
food.” “If a wife misbehaved, the chief did not divorce her, but made her work all
the harder”. And Rochas tells us that the New Caledonians keep no servants, but have
many wives instead; rich men have as many wives as they want for the cultivation of
their fields<a class="noteRef" id="n391.3src" href="#n391.3">268</a>.
</p>
<p>In Neu Pommern, according to Parkinson, “every man who can afford it buys many wives.
For a wife is a capital that yields a fair interest; she works from an early age till
her strength is spent; and when, from age or by being overtaxed with labour, she grows
sickly and decrepit, she perishes unheeded by anybody. The wife is nothing but the
beast of burden of her husband; she performs all labour, tills the soil, cleans the
dwelling, prepares the food, and carries the reaped produce in heavy baskets far away
to the market. The husband therefore regards his wife as a valuable property.” “The
husband continually urges his wives to work, that they may earn much <i>dewarra</i> [shell-money] for him; for the more <i>dewarra</i> he owns the greater is the consideration and influence he enjoys. But the lot of
the wives is not bettered by an increase in the wealth of the husband. The wives of
a man who owns thousands of coils of <i>dewarra</i> have no better life and are no <span class="pageNum" id="pb392">[<a href="#pb392">392</a>]</span>less overworked than the wife of a very poor man who has no property except his only
wife.” And Danks states that “a man may have as many wives as he can afford to purchase.
If he cannot afford to purchase one, and his credit is low, he may have to remain
single. The headmen are generally rich men, hence they invariably have a number of
wives, ranging from three to six”. “Married life in New Britain is a hard one for
the women. They are beaten and ill-treated by their husbands as occasion may arise”<a class="noteRef" id="n392.1src" href="#n392.1">269</a>.
</p>
<p>In New Mecklenburg the condition of the women is equally bad<a class="noteRef" id="n392.2src" href="#n392.2">270</a>.
</p>
<p>In Fiji, according to Williams, “polygamy is looked upon as a principal source of
a chiefs power and wealth.” And Pritchard says: “The greater the number of wives a
man had, the better his social position.… Besides the acknowledged wives, there were
attached to the household of the chiefs slave-women, who, though performing the most
menial services, were at the same time nothing else than what the odalisques are in
the Turkish harem”<a class="noteRef" id="n392.3src" href="#n392.3">271</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that these Melanesian wives supply the place of slaves. They are bought like
slaves; they have to work for their owners like slaves; and their labour, like that
of slaves, increases the wealth of their lords. Another point of resemblance is this.
In slave countries it is generally the rich only who are able to procure slaves; poor
freemen have to work for themselves. Here it is the rich who appropriate the women;
and many of the poor have to remain single. Here, as in all countries where polygamy
is practised, it is only the minority of the men who can live in polygamy; for everywhere
the number of women is nearly equal to that of men. And as in Melanesia the rich,
who otherwise would want slaves, have many wives to work for them, slaves are not
required.
</p>
<p>We cannot explain here why in Melanesia womankind is so much at a discount, whereas
among some other savage tribes (<i>e.g.</i> on the North Pacific Coast of North America) the sex <span class="pageNum" id="pb393">[<a href="#pb393">393</a>]</span>commands such respect<a class="noteRef" id="n393.1src" href="#n393.1">272</a>. But we clearly see what is the effect of this state of things. Much labour is wanted;
otherwise the women would not have to work so hard, and the rich would not keep so
many female labourers. Yet slaves are not kept in any considerable number, because
the women supply the place of slaves.
</p>
<p>One might object, that possibly the women are held in such a slavelike state because
male slaves are impossible or very difficult to procure, or because the coercive power
of these tribes is not strong enough to admit of the keeping of slaves, or because
male captives, where they are introduced into the tribe (as in the islands Bougainville
Straits), are wanted for warriors. Shortly expressed the objection is, that slavery
is not wanting because there exists a “slavery of women,” but “slavery of women” exists
because slavery proper is wanting. We must own that this is quite possible. But, whatever
be the cause of this “slavery of women,” as soon as it exists it renders slavery less
necessary than it would otherwise be. War is frequent in Melanesia<a class="noteRef" id="n393.2src" href="#n393.2">273</a>, so there is no physical impossibility of procuring captives. And though it may be
difficult to keep male slaves subjected,—if the men were unable to impose all work
on the women and obliged to perform their due share of it themselves, they would decidedly
take more pains to procure slaves and set them to work. A low condition of women,
though only a <span class="corr" id="xd32e19467" title="Source: secundary">secondary</span> factor, certainly is a factor which tends to make slavery proper superfluous.

</p>
<p>We use the term “commercial tribes” in a wide sense, as including not only those tribes
among which many people subsist by trading, but those that exchange a considerable
part of their produce for foreign merchandise. For instance, a tribe that grows corn
for export is a commercial tribe in the sense we attach to the word.
</p>
<p>We see that, with very few exceptions, all commercial agricultural tribes keep slaves.
This proves that among agricultural tribes the development of trade greatly furthers
the growth of slavery.
</p>
<p>We have not much to say in explanation of this fact. When speaking of the slave-keeping
tribes of the Pacific Coast of North America, we have already remarked that the development
of trade tends to further slavery in various ways. Commercial tribes are likely to
carry on a trade in slaves, and this makes the keeping of slaves very easy. Where
the freemen take to commercial pursuits, they want others to perform the common drudgery
for every-day subsistence. The trade itself may also require menial work: the articles
of commerce have to be prepared and transported, trading vessels have to be rowed,
etc. And finally, commerce often leads to a development of wealth and luxury; a man
can now, by the labour of his slaves, acquire not only the necessaries, but the refinements
of life<a class="noteRef" id="n394.1src" href="#n394.1">274</a>.
</p>
<p>The last point is an important one. In self-dependent agricultural countries the main
use of slave labour consists in <span class="pageNum" id="pb395">[<a href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>providing the master with food. If, then, a man keeps a large number of slaves who
work for him, he is able to entertain his friends, or to keep a retinue of unproductive
slaves or servants, whose wants are provided for by the work of the soil-tilling slaves.
But where this is the sole profit one can derive from one’s slaves, an owner who keeps
a considerable number of them does not want to make them work very hard; he often
contents himself with receiving a tribute, and so the slaves become serfs. In this
way the slave-owner gets less out of his slaves than would otherwise be the case;
but he does not want more, and he need not now continually supervise their work. Slavery
is not likely to exist on a large scale.
</p>
<p>Where commercial relations with foreign parts are maintained, it is otherwise. A slave-owner
who receives large quantities of agricultural produce from his slaves can now exchange
them for foreign merchandise. Retaining for himself as much food as he wants, he exchanges
the rest for such objects as are either useful and agreeable in themselves, or give
him distinction among his countrymen. The use of slave labour becomes thus practically
unlimited. Kohler rightly remarks that only where the economic instinct is awake,
can slavery attain to a full development, and Schmoller observes that, when the patriarchal
family began to produce for the market, covetousness and pursuit of gain arose and
the treatment of slaves became worse<a class="noteRef" id="n395.1src" href="#n395.1">275</a>.
</p>
<p>We must further take into consideration that slavery on a very large scale is only
possible, where industrial crops are raised. “Tobacco and cotton” says Cairnes, “fulfil
that condition which we saw was essential to the economical employment of slaves—the
possibility of working large numbers within a limited space; while wheat and Indian
corn, in the cultivation of which the labourers are dispersed over a wide surface,
fail in this respect”<a class="noteRef" id="n395.2src" href="#n395.2">276</a>. And cotton and similar crops are only cultivated in large quantity where they are
exported.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of such “wholesale slavery”, as Bagehot terms it, we find a few instances among savage
tribes.
</p>
<p>Köler tells us that in Bonny the great majority of the inhabitants are slaves. The
keeping of slaves is very expensive, as agriculture and industry scarcely exist; all
food has to be imported. The freemen are traders in palm-oil, and want large numbers
of slaves to row the canoes in which this oil is transported<a class="noteRef" id="n396.1src" href="#n396.1">277</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Ewe of the Slave Coast slavery is practised on a very large scale. Some
men keep 200–300 slaves, who form their capital. The slaves are generally employed
in carrying oil from the inland to the coast for sale to Europeans. The maintaining
of order among such great numbers of slaves requires great severity. Slavery marks
all their institutions. It is a common saying with them that “the large water-tub
does not go to the spring”, whereby they mean that freemen must not do such work as
is only fit for slaves and boys<a class="noteRef" id="n396.2src" href="#n396.2">278</a>.
</p>
<p>Miss Kingsley, speaking of the social classes among the tribes, inhabiting the territory
of the Oil Rivers on the Western Coast of Africa, says: “The third and fourth classes
are true slave classes, the higher one in rank being what is called the Winnaboes
or Trade boys, the lower the pull-away boys and the plantation hands. The best point
in it, as a system, is that it gives to the poorest boy who paddles an oil canoe a
chance of becoming a king”<a class="noteRef" id="n396.3src" href="#n396.3">279</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Garos, where cotton is the principal culture, two-fifths of the population
are slaves. “The distinction [between freemen and slaves] is jealously preserved.…
It is from the possession of a large number of them [slaves] that a man obtains influence
amongst his tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n396.4src" href="#n396.4">280</a>.
</p>
<p>It is clear that among these tribes slavery would not prevail to such a great extent,
if the preparing and transporting of the articles of export did not require so much
labour.
</p>
<p>In these cases trade is the cause of “wholesale slavery”, not necessarily of slavery
in general. “Retail slavery” may have <span class="pageNum" id="pb397">[<a href="#pb397">397</a>]</span>existed among these tribes before they became so largely commercial. But, seeing that
among them the extension of commercial relations has so greatly increased the use
of slave labour, we may safely suppose that in several cases the development of trade
has given rise to slavery among tribes which did not practise it before. This is also
made probable by the list given at the beginning of this paragraph.
</p>
<p>We shall not proceed to a closer investigation of this subject. We have already remarked
that as yet we know very little about the general effects of trade and the place it
occupies in social life among savages. And we must know more of this, before we can
arrive at any accurate conclusion with regard to the influence of trade on the rise
and growth of slavery.
</p>
<p>When speaking of hunters and fishers, we have found that the influence of trade is
more considerable where manufactured goods, than where raw products are exported.
This will probably also apply to agricultural tribes, viz. if we take the term “manufactured
goods” in a wide sense, as including agricultural produce. Raw products in our sense
means articles which can be exported without any labour being previously applied to
them, <i>e.g.</i> the various kinds of stone and earth exchanged by Eskimos and Australians. The articles
exported by commercial agricultural tribes are nearly always manufactured goods in
this wider sense.
</p>
<p>It might be interesting to divide the commercial tribes (in the wider sense) into
three categories, according as they export agricultural produce, manufactured goods
in the common, restricted sense, or articles purchased abroad (articles of transit
trade), the last category comprising the commercial tribes in the restricted sense,
and inquire what are the social effects of commerce in each case. But such a subject
wants separate treatment; we cannot deal with it here. We will only express our opinion,
that the significance of trade and industry among savages is commonly underrated.
Whether we are right here will appear when these points have been more closely studied
than they are now.
</p>
<p>In another paragraph we shall have to speak of a peculiar branch of trade, the trade
in slaves.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In several cases it is stated that slaves are employed in warfare. Leaving out of
regard the cattle-breeding agricultural tribes, of which we have already spoken in
chapter III, we find the following instances.
</p>
<p>Thomson tells us that in New Zealand slaves accompanied their masters on fishing and
fighting expeditions; and in another place he states that women and slaves accompanied
the warriors to carry burdens<a class="noteRef" id="n398.1src" href="#n398.1">281</a>. Polack says: “Slaves are permitted to take part in a war”, and Brown, speaking of
slaves in New Zealand, remarks: “If any of them show superior talents for war, they
are duly appreciated, and many slaves by this means raise themselves to the chieftainship
of the tribe”<a class="noteRef" id="n398.2src" href="#n398.2">282</a>.
</p>
<p>Dalton, speaking of the slaves kept by the Garos, says: “It is from the possession
of a large number of them that a man obtains influence amongst his tribe. Each great
chief can go to war with a body-guard of 60 such followers entirely devoted to him”<a class="noteRef" id="n398.3src" href="#n398.3">283</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Lawas too, according to Colquhoun, slaves are employed as warriors<a class="noteRef" id="n398.4src" href="#n398.4">284</a>.
</p>
<p>In Nias slaves are often compelled to go to war with their masters, except when war
is made upon the native village of the slaves. The slaves fight bravely, and in war
bear arms like the freemen, but are never set at liberty for their bravery<a class="noteRef" id="n398.5src" href="#n398.5">285</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Kayans slaves serve as warriors and can even become war-chiefs<a class="noteRef" id="n398.6src" href="#n398.6">286</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the natives of Central Celebes, slaves who excel in those qualities which are
highly valued in freemen, <i>i<span class="corr" id="xd32e19663" title="Source: ,">.</span>e<span class="corr" id="xd32e19666" title="Source: ,">.</span></i> bravery or oratorical power, are practically no longer regarded as slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n398.7src" href="#n398.7">287</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Tagals and Visayas, in the time of the <span lang="es">conquista</span>, generally freemen and vassals only took part in military <span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>operations; but sometimes slaves too, especially in naval wars: the slaves were then
employed for rowing the boats<a class="noteRef" id="n399.1src" href="#n399.1">288</a>.
</p>
<p>The forces sent out by Lunda chiefs on marauding expeditions consist of freemen and
slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n399.2src" href="#n399.2">289</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Angoni the domestic slaves join their masters in the slave-raids<a class="noteRef" id="n399.3src" href="#n399.3">290</a>.
</p>
<p>Bérenger-Féraud tells us that among the Wolofs the slaves of the king are soldiers
and form his body-guard; they also collect taxes for him<a class="noteRef" id="n399.4src" href="#n399.4">291</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Barea and Kunama the spoils taken in war by a native-born slave belong to
his master<a class="noteRef" id="n399.5src" href="#n399.5">292</a>. Hence it appears that these slaves are employed in warfare.
</p>
<p>In the French Soudan the master provides his domestic slaves with arms and takes them
with him to the battle-field<a class="noteRef" id="n399.6src" href="#n399.6">293</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Soninkays and Malinkays of French Guinea, one class of warriors is composed
of the slaves of the chiefs. At the close of a war they return to their agricultural
pursuits; but they are always ready to take arms again<a class="noteRef" id="n399.7src" href="#n399.7">294</a>.
</p>
<p>These are the only instances we have noticed, of purely agricultural tribes among
which slaves perform a military function. There may be some more cases. Our informants
do not always enter into many details; therefore, when they are silent on the subject,
this does not always prove that slaves are not allowed to fight. Yet, considering
the small number of instances we have been able to collect, we may safely conclude
that among most agricultural tribes slaves do not share in military operations.
</p>
<p>This is what we expected. Slaves are not allowed to follow the noble military art,
which is the privilege of freemen<a class="noteRef" id="n399.8src" href="#n399.8">295</a>. A slave is not a warrior for the same reason that he is not a hunter. Moreover,
it were too dangerous to trust him with weapons; he might be inclined to rise against
his oppressors. And finally, when slaves are procured by capture in war or kidnapping,
they would often have to fight against their own <span class="pageNum" id="pb400">[<a href="#pb400">400</a>]</span>tribe, and would be very likely to go over to the enemies of their masters.
</p>
<p>It is further remarkable that the tribes we have enumerated in this paragraph are
all in the higher stages of agriculture, as may be seen from chapter I. We have not
found a single instance of hunting agriculturists employing their slaves in warfare.
There are even hunting agriculturists of the lowest type, of whom it is explicitly
stated that they do not allow their slaves to fight. Martius tells us that several
wild tribes of Brazil keep slaves. The slaves are differently treated by the different
tribes; but it is a general characteristic of slavery, that slaves are not allowed
to bear arms<a class="noteRef" id="n400.1src" href="#n400.1">296</a>. And Azara states that in his time the Mbayas subsisted on hunting and fishing, and
on the produce of the soil that was tilled to a small extent by their slaves and by
a neighbouring tribe, the Guanas. Here too, warfare was the business of the freemen
to the exclusion of the slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n400.2src" href="#n400.2">297</a>.
</p>
<p>This may, at first sight, seem strange. If it is true, as Powell asserts, (and it
does not seem to us improbable) that slavery originated from the adoption of captives<a class="noteRef" id="n400.3src" href="#n400.3">298</a>, we should expect to find an intermediate stage, in which the captives, though already
enslaved instead of adopted, still shared in military operations, the differentiation
of the “regulative part of society” from the “operative part” (to borrow Spencer’s
words) not yet being complete. The existence of slavery, mainly for military purposes,
among the hunting Abipones and some pastoral tribes, seems to indicate such a stage.
But among agricultural tribes we find no trace of it. Some agricultural tribes (of
which the Iroquois are the classical instance) adopt their captives; then there are
many which keep slaves who are not allowed to fight; and, finally, in the higher stages
of agriculture, we find a few tribes among which slaves share in military operations.
</p>
<p>Yet the cause of this seeming incongruity is not difficult to detect. Pastoral tribes
are always stronger, from a military point of view, than primitive agricultural tribes.
In chapter III we have seen that the former often keep their agricultural <span class="pageNum" id="pb401">[<a href="#pb401">401</a>]</span>neighbours in a state of subjection. Therefore it is much easier for them to employ
their slaves in warfare than for hunting agriculturists; the latter, if they are to
keep slaves at all, must take care to disarm them and so prevent them from doing harm.
</p>
<p>Among agriculturists in the higher stages it is otherwise. There is often an elaborate
division of labour; the governing classes are differentiated from the labouring classes,
and the army is regularly constituted. Now it is not at all dangerous to enlist the
slaves into the inferior ranks of the army, under the lead of the governing classes.
The slaves, generally brought by traders from a far distance, have no longer to fight
against their native tribe, but against strangers. And where slavery prevails to a
great extent, the owners of numerous slaves, who form the aristocracy, will often
be inclined to rely on their slaves for the maintenance of their power over the common
freemen; whereas the slaves, who are no longer on the same footing of familiarity
with the freemen as in primitive slavery, but despised and hated for being the tools
of the aristocracy, regard their master as their natural protector and are willing
to stand <span class="corr" id="xd32e19744" title="Source: bij">by</span> him<a class="noteRef" id="n401.1src" href="#n401.1">299</a>.
</p>
<p>Such was the course of evolution in ancient Rome. In the old times the slaves were
not allowed to fight. “For entering the military service or taking on him any state
office, a slave was punished with death”<a class="noteRef" id="n401.2src" href="#n401.2">300</a>. But later on a change took place. Speaking of the last days of the republic, Ingram
remarks: “In the subsequent civil conflicts the aid of slaves was sought by both parties,
even by Marius himself, and afterwards by Catiline, though he finally rejected their
services. Clodius and Milo employed bands of gladiators in their city riots, and this
action on the part of the latter was approved by Cicero. In the First Civil War they
were to be found in both camps, and the murderers of Caesar, those <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> vindicators of liberty, were escorted to the Capitol by gladiators. Antony, Octavius,
and Sextus Pompeius employed them in the Second Civil War”<a class="noteRef" id="n401.3src" href="#n401.3">301</a>. But the slaves soon began to take arms against <span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span>those who had taught them to fight. “It is recorded <span class="corr" id="xd32e19763" title="Source: bij">by</span> Augustus on the <span lang="la">Monumentum Ancyranum</span> that he gave back to their masters for punishment about 30,000 slaves who had absconded
and borne arms against the state. Under Tiberius, at the death of Caligula, and in
the reign of Nero, there were threatening movements of the slaves. Nor did the danger
of servile insurrection disappear in the later stages of the Empire. The armies of
the invading Goths were swelled by their countrymen who had been captured or bought
by Romans<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> The slaves of Gaul almost <i>en masse</i> took part in the revolt of the Bagaudae, and forty thousand slaves joined Alaric
at the siege of Rome”<a class="noteRef" id="n402.1src" href="#n402.1">302</a>.
</p>
<p>The last passage shows that even in a state where the power of the government and
the military art are highly developed it is not safe to employ slaves in warfare.
They may actually be the ready tools of the aristocracy; but in the long run they
will come to form a dangerous element in the state. Yet, as it may be momentarily
convenient to an ambitious statesman to employ them, it will sometimes be done; whereas
among hunting agriculturists the danger is so obvious that it is not even attempted.
</p>
<p>As it is only among a few agricultural tribes, and these in the higher stages, that
slaves perform a military function, we cannot think that this has been an important
factor in the rise of slavery; and it has probably been nowhere the only motive for
making slaves.
</p>
<p>Something analogous to the employment of slaves in warfare is their holding high offices
of state. This occurs in some despotically governed African countries. Goldstein remarks
that in the Soudan states the numerous court and state offices are generally held
by slaves. The king prefers them as public officers to royal princes, who might be
inclined to rise against him<a class="noteRef" id="n402.2src" href="#n402.2">303</a>. Among the Bayanzi, according to Torday and Joyce, “the great chief usually has a
confidential adviser, who, in all cases observed, was a slave; such slaves have great
influence, and receive numerous presents from their masters; they often impersonate
the chief before strangers, while their master keeps <span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403">403</a>]</span>in the background”<a class="noteRef" id="n403.1src" href="#n403.1">304</a>. In imperial Rome freedmen were appointed to high offices<a class="noteRef" id="n403.2src" href="#n403.2">305</a>.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 16.</span> <i>Slaves kept as a luxury.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sometimes we are told that it is considered an honour to possess many slaves. We shall
give a few instances.
</p>
<p>Among the Lampongs the keeping of slaves is indicative of wealth and power<a class="noteRef" id="n403.3src" href="#n403.3">306</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Tagals and Visayas, in the time of the <span lang="es">conquista</span>, a man’s influence, power and reputation depended on the number of his slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n403.4src" href="#n403.4">307</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Ininga and Galloa it is the ambition of a freeman to have as many slaves
as possible<a class="noteRef" id="n403.5src" href="#n403.5">308</a>.
</p>
<p>Compiègne states that a Mpongwe asked him to give him a portion of his wages in advance,
in order to buy a slave. “He will work for me and my wife” said the man, “and I shall
be a person of rank”<a class="noteRef" id="n403.6src" href="#n403.6">309</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Bambala, “when a man buys a new slave, he ornaments him on the first day
with his best clothes and ornaments, and walks round the village with him to show
him to his friends”<a class="noteRef" id="n403.7src" href="#n403.7">310</a>.
</p>
<p>We have only taken a few instances at random. It cannot be interesting to the reader
to know how often the same fact has been noticed by ethnographers. For we may suppose
that wherever slavery exists, the possession of a great number of slaves is a mark
of distinction. The possession of slaves, like other property, is indicative of wealth;
and where slaves are acquired by capture in war it shows the bravery of the captor.
Moreover, among agricultural tribes the labour of the slaves augments the revenue
of their owner, and so the keeping of slaves is not only a sign but a source of wealth;
therefore the slave-owner is looked upon as one who has at his disposal a means of
acquiring wealth. Martius, speaking of the wild tribes of Brazil, remarks that a chief
who keeps many slaves can <span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404">404</a>]</span>take more land into cultivation than other people. He has therefore always an abundant
supply of food, which tends to increase the esteem in which he is held<a class="noteRef" id="n404.1src" href="#n404.1">311</a>.
</p>
<p>Where industry and art are little developed, slaves, besides wives and domestic animals,
are almost the only luxury that is to be had. The reader will remember Levchine’s
statement about a rich Kazak Kirghiz, whose numerous horses gave him no profit, but
great renown<a class="noteRef" id="n404.2src" href="#n404.2">312</a>. In the lower stages of culture a rich man cannot build a palace, or keep a motor-car,
or buy pictures; he can only show his wealth to the public by keeping a large number
of men or domestic animals continually running about him. Leroy-Beaulieu justly remarks:
“The luxury of primitive times is very simple; it consists mainly in the grouping
about the rich man (who most often is at the same time a man of high birth) of a large
body of servants maintained by him, and in practising hospitality on a large scale.
Among patriarchal peoples there is almost perfect equality of material life between
men of different stations. Food, clothing, furniture even, differs but little”<a class="noteRef" id="n404.3src" href="#n404.3">313</a>.
</p>
<p>But, though a rich man may display his wealth by keeping a great number of slaves,
we do not mean to say that among any agricultural tribe all slaves are kept as a mere
luxury. This seems improbable. Among pastoral tribes, as we have seen before, it sometimes
occurs. The owner of numerous herds may support a large body of slaves, who have scarcely
anything to do. But among agricultural tribes it is quite otherwise. Subsistence here
is largely dependent on labour; much labour is required to provide for the slaves,
and the master will not choose to work for them himself. The slaves, therefore, must
perform at least as much productive labour as is required to provide for their own
wants; and there is no reason why the master should not make them work somewhat more,
to receive a surplus; the more so, as he is thus enabled to display his wealth in
the other manner mentioned by Leroy-Beaulieu, viz. by practising hospitality on a
large scale.
</p>
<p>It is, of course, perfectly possible, and indeed it often occurs, <span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>that <i>some</i> slaves are kept as a mere luxury, either doing nothing at all, or performing personal
services. But then there must be other slaves who, by performing productive labour,
provide for their master, their fellow-slaves, and themselves. There cannot be a class
of unproductive labourers, without there being a class of productive labourers too.
We can only imagine one case, in which all slaves might be kept as a mere luxury.
It might be, that there were a class of productive labourers consisting of freemen,
who provided for the slave-owners and their unproductive slaves. There might, for
instance, be an aristocracy, levying taxes on the common people and keeping slaves
as a luxury. Such is indeed the case among the pastoral Beni Amer. It might also occur
among agricultural tribes; but we have not found any instance of it.
</p>
<p>Only in two cases have we found it stated that slaves are not productive.
</p>
<p>Coquilhat tells us that on the Upper Congo the keeping of slaves does not increase
the master’s income; for agriculture is insignificant, and these tribes are not commercial.
But he also states that the soil is tilled by old women and male slaves, so slaves
do not seem to be kept as a mere luxury<a class="noteRef" id="n405.1src" href="#n405.1">314</a>.
</p>
<p>Among the Fanti, according to Finsch, slaves are articles of luxury; they are as lazy
as their masters. They are acquired as prisoners of war or by purchase. Every noble
Fanti owns numerous slaves; for it is a mark of distinction to keep many of them.
Some slaves carry parasols or fans; others by trumpeting announce the arrival of the
patrician. Most of them do nothing at all. But the same writer states that the condition
of the pawns (who, as has been shown in the first chapter of Part I, are a kind of
slaves) is much worse than that of the slaves in the restricted sense<a class="noteRef" id="n405.2src" href="#n405.2">315</a>. We may therefore suppose that these pawns are the productive labourers.
</p>
<p>We have never found it explicitly stated that among any agricultural tribe slaves
are not employed in agriculture.
</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that luxury has not probably been among any agricultural tribe the
only motive for keeping slaves. <span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span>Yet many slaves are kept as a mere luxury, and consequently among some tribes slaves
are far more numerous than they would be if all of them were engaged in productive
pursuits.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have seen that among the tribes of the Pacific Coast of North America the growth
of slavery is furthered by their preserving food for the time of scarcity, whereas
hunters who live from hand to mouth have less use for slave labour.
</p>
<p>Hunting agriculturists much resemble true hunters: subsistence depends largely on
the vicissitudes of the chase. But where a tribe lives principally on the produce
of the soil, it is necessary to preserve the reaped fruits until the following harvest.
</p>
<p>This leads to the same conclusion we had already arrived at, that slavery is more
likely to exist among agriculturists of the higher stages than among hunting agriculturists<a class="noteRef" id="n406.1src" href="#n406.1">316</a>. We do not think that anything more need be said on this subject.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In our chapter on pastoral tribes we have found that subjection of tribes as such
sometimes serves as a substitute for slavery, making slavery proper superfluous. The
same proved to be the case among agriculturists who depend on cattle for a large portion
of their subsistence. Something analogous to this is the levying of tributes on conquered
districts that so often occurs in Oceania, as we have found in § 8. Outside Oceania
we have found only one instance among agriculturists who do not depend on cattle,
and even this is a doubtful one. Morgan states that among the Iroquois the council
“regulated the affairs of subjugated tribes”<a class="noteRef" id="n406.2src" href="#n406.2">317</a>; but he does not enter into more details, so we cannot exactly know what he means.
</p>
<p>It is easy to understand, why subjection of tribes so seldom occurs among agriculturists.
Hunting agriculturists, like true <span class="pageNum" id="pb407">[<a href="#pb407">407</a>]</span>hunters, generally live in small groups and therefore cannot keep other tribes in
a state of subjection. And among agricultural tribes of the higher stages men as well
as women are continually engaged in agricultural labour; they are attached to the
spot on which they live and, unlike nomadic cattle-keepers<a class="noteRef" id="n407.1src" href="#n407.1">318</a>, cannot easily control a neighbouring tribe. The vanquished tribe, by retreating
a little, can place itself out of reach of the conquering tribe. Only where, as on
the small Polynesian islands, escape is not practicable, can a vanquished district
be kept in a state of subjection. The Iroquois were an exceptional case. They were
hunting agriculturists in this sense, that agricultural labour was performed by the
women only; but at the same time they had a strong military organization: the five
nations formed a powerful union.
</p>
<p>In the higher stages of culture the growth of militarism enables strong agricultural
peoples to subject their weaker neighbours; and the growth of population prevents
the latter from receding. But among agricultural savages subjugation of tribes is
rarely found.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum">§ 18.</span> <i>External causes, especially the slave-trade. Recapitulation.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the second and third chapters we have spoken of external causes. We have seen that
for slavery to exist it is not sufficient that there should be some use for slave
labour; it must also be possible to keep slaves; the freemen of the tribe must have
a coercive power strong enough to keep the slaves subjected and prevent them from
escaping. It has been shown that this coercive power is most strongly developed, where
men have fixed habitations, live in large groups, and preserve food; and further,
that the slave-trade greatly facilitates the keeping of slaves.
</p>
<p>As for the first three points, it is easy to see that agricultural tribes of the higher
stages are more settled, live in larger groups, and are more likely to preserve food
than hunting <span class="pageNum" id="pb408">[<a href="#pb408">408</a>]</span>agriculturists<a class="noteRef" id="n408.1src" href="#n408.1">319</a>, so here again we find a reason why slavery is so much more frequent among the former
than among the latter.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The slave-trade is of more interest to us here. It has been, shown that among the
tribes of the Pacific Coast of North America a brisk trade in slaves was carried on,
which must have greatly accelerated the growth of slavery; for it made the keeping
of slaves much easier than it would have been if each of these tribes had had to procure
its slaves by capture in war. It has also been remarked that among pastoral tribes
slavery exists almost exclusively in those parts, <span class="corr" id="xd32e19922" title="Source: were">where</span> a trade in slaves with civilized or semi-civilized peoples is or was carried on,
viz. in Arabia, the Caucasus, North-east and North-west Africa; whereas the pastoral
tribes that live in outlying regions (Siberia, South Africa) with the only exception
of the Ovaherero, do not keep slaves. We shall inquire now whether the same is the
case with agricultural tribes, whether among them too slavery is of rare occurrence
in those parts where the slave-trade has never been carried on.
</p>
<p>In North America, at the time of its discovery, slavery did not exist among any agricultural
tribe. Negro slavery, practised by a few of them in later times, was derived from
the whites.
</p>
<p>In South America we have found only a few slave-keeping agricultural tribes; and the
slave-trade formerly carried on by the whites may go far to explain the existence
of slavery in these few cases. “The Brazilian native” says Martius “sometimes sells
his children to people of white races, much oftener than to those of his own colour.”
The principal object of warfare among the natives, in Martius’ time, was to capture
slaves, whom they sold either to other tribes or to colonists of Portuguese extraction.
The custom of selling prisoners to white colonists has strongly influenced the native
character. It was already practised very shortly after the discovery of America. Many
Indians were transported to Spain and Portugal. The Mamelucos, living in San Paolo,
made long and sanguinary wars upon the Indians. They are said during 130 years to
have killed <span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span>and enslaved more than two millions of Indians. Pedro de Avila, governor of Buenos
Ayres, complained that the Paulistas carried on this trade in public and from 1628
to 1630 had brought 60,000 Indians to the market at Rio Janeiro. The whites continually
availed themselves of the quarrels of the several Indian tribes, to procure such Indians
as had been made prisoners. Even in Martius’ time this trade went on, especially in
thinly peopled, outlying districts, where the Brazilian government could not prevent
it. The wars of the Indians were simply marauding expeditions; their object was to
procure prisoners for sale to Brazilian whites<a class="noteRef" id="n409.1src" href="#n409.1">320</a>.
</p>
<p>In Oceania, slavery was an aboriginal institution in New Zealand and part of the Solomon
group and the Bismarck Archipelago. From the lack of details concerning a system of
slave labour, we must conclude that in these islands the economic use of slaves was
small. Slavery further existed in the western part of New Guinea, where it probably
still exists. Here foreign influence clearly appears. In the eastern part of the island,
that till quite recently had not been visited by foreigners (British and German New
Guinea), slavery is unknown; and the western part (Dutch New Guinea), where slavery
exists, was for a long time under the rule of the sultan of Tidore<a class="noteRef" id="n409.2src" href="#n409.2">321</a>. The tribute which the inhabitants of New Guinea had to pay to the sultan consisted
partly of slaves; moreover, many Papuans were captured as slaves in the <i>hongi</i> raids<a class="noteRef" id="n409.3src" href="#n409.3">322</a>. This, however, is not sufficient to account for the keeping of slaves by Papuans
themselves. But we may consider, first that several districts on the coast are inhabited
by a mongrel race of Papuans and Malays (<i>e.g.</i> on the Gulf of Macluer), and secondly that the trade with Tidore, Serang, and other
Malay countries must have thoroughly changed the natives’ mode of life. Thus we are
told that the Dorey people have become somewhat civilized by their intercourse with
traders from the Moluccas<a class="noteRef" id="n409.4src" href="#n409.4">323</a>. We may notice here that all districts where slavery is carried on lie on the coast,
and are therefore easiest of access to foreigners. And those districts of Dutch New
Guinea of which it is stated <span class="pageNum" id="pb410">[<a href="#pb410">410</a>]</span>that there are no slaves, Humboldt Bay and Hattam, have never been visited by <i>hongi</i> fleets<a class="noteRef" id="n410.1src" href="#n410.1">324</a>. Accordingly, Ottow and Geissler remark that the mountain tribes do not keep slaves,
but kill all their prisoners, for fear they might escape. The coast tribes, however,
being able to procure slaves from a great distance, who are less likely to escape,
practise slavery<a class="noteRef" id="n410.2src" href="#n410.2">325</a>.
</p>
<p>In the Malay Archipelago Mohammedanism already prevailed to a great extent before
the <span lang="es">conquista</span>, and had even advanced as far as the Philippines<a class="noteRef" id="n410.3src" href="#n410.3">326</a>. Wherever slavery exists in the Archipelago, we are not certain that we have to deal
with a phenomenon of unadulterated savage life. The influence of semi-civilized Mohammedans
spreads over nearly the whole of the Archipelago.
</p>
<p>In India the slave-trade with semi-civilized countries is, or was, also carried on
by the natives. Cooper states that the Meshmees sell slaves to Tibet<a class="noteRef" id="n410.4src" href="#n410.4">327</a>. According to Colquhoun the Karen-nee sell many slaves to the Shans of Zimmé and
these again to the Siamese<a class="noteRef" id="n410.5src" href="#n410.5">328</a>. And Rousselet tells us that among the Kafirs “slavery exists within certain limits,
but this criminal commerce would cease altogether if there were not such a ready sale
for slaves at Djalalabad, Kounar, Asmar and Tchitral”<a class="noteRef" id="n410.6src" href="#n410.6">329</a>.
</p>
<p>From the Caucasus, as we have already seen, slaves are exported to Turkey on a large
scale<a class="noteRef" id="n410.7src" href="#n410.7">330</a>.
</p>
<p>Africa is the classical country of the slave-trade. Egypt and Ethiopia furnished a
certain number of slaves to ancient Greece, and at Rome there was a regular importation
of slaves, some of whom were brought from Africa<a class="noteRef" id="n410.8src" href="#n410.8">331</a>. Herodotus speaks of slaves sent to ancient Egypt as tribute from Ethiopia<a class="noteRef" id="n410.9src" href="#n410.9">332</a>. That in later times the African slave-trade, carried on by Arabs in East Africa
and by Europeans in West Africa, assumed enormous proportions, need scarcely be said.
In the later half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century the Mohammedan East still received a large supply of slaves from Africa.
Ingram remarks: “The principal centres from which in recent times the supply has been
furnished to Egypt, Morocco, Turkey, Arabia, and Persia, are three in number. 1. The
Soudan, south of the Great Sahara, <span class="pageNum" id="pb411">[<a href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>appears to be one vast hunting-ground. Captives are brought thence to the slave-market
of Kuka in Bornu.… Negroes are also brought to Morocco from the Western Soudan, and
from Timbuktu.… 2. The basin of the Nile, extending to the great lakes, is another
region infested by the slave trade.… 3. There has long been a slave-trade from the
East African coast. The stream of supply came mainly from the southern Nyassa districts
by three or four routes to Ibo, Mozambique, Angoche, and Kilimane. Madagascar and
the Comoro Islands obtained most of their slaves from the Mozambique coast.… There
are other minor branches of the trade elsewhere in Africa. Thus from Harar in Somâliland
caravans are sent to Berberah on the coast, where there is a great annual fair. The
slaves are collected from the inland Galla countries, from Gurâgwe, and from Abyssinia,
the Abyssinians being the most highly esteemed”<a class="noteRef" id="n411.1src" href="#n411.1">333</a>.
</p>
<p>We see that in most parts of the world inhabited by slave-keeping agricultural savages,
slaves are, or were, purchased or captured by civilized or semi-civilized peoples;
whereas in those parts where the slave-trade has always been unknown, slavery has
never prevailed to any considerable extent.
</p>
<p>We shall try to account for this fact. But we must first reply to a question which
the reader may perhaps have asked, viz. why we have not at the beginning of this second
Part discussed the question as to whether slavery is ever a phenomenon of genuine
savage life, or has always been due to intercourse with higher races. We have not
done so, because it seems to us that this question is one of secondary interest. When
we see that among a savage tribe slavery is an institution playing a great part in
native life and slave labour is of much use, we must come to the conclusion that slavery
is perfectly consistent with the economic and social state in which this tribe lives,
whether intercourse with superior races gave rise to it or it already existed before
any such intercourse had taken place. And the conclusions we have arrived at in this
and the foregoing chapters, as to the various circumstances <span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412">412</a>]</span>which further or prevent slavery, remain the same in both cases. Moreover, there are
some savage tribes which at the time of their discovery kept slaves without, so far
as we know, having had any intercourse with superior races: the New Zealanders and
the fishing tribes of Kamchatka and the North Pacific Coast of North America.
</p>
<p>Yet, as we have already said, those parts of the world where we have found most of
our positive cases are exactly those where the slave-trade has been carried on by
civilized and semi-civilized peoples. Going on to account for this fact, we may remark
first that it need not have been the slave-trade only that furthered the growth of
slavery. The general intercourse with superior races may go far to account for the
rise of slavery, irrespectively of the slave-trade. We have seen that commercial tribes
are more likely to keep slaves than others; and a savage tribe can engage in commerce
with superior peoples, who buy large quantities of native produce and introduce foreign
manufactures, to a far greater extent than with neighbouring savages who have not
much to exchange, as their own and their neighbours’ mode of life and industrial development
are nearly the same. A remarkable instance of the influence of commercial intercourse
with Europeans on the slave system of a savage race is afforded by Polack’s description
of the Maori. Formerly, he says, “for a chief to enter his new abode [in the world
of spirits], without being ushered by a number of slaves and wives [who were sacrificed],
was accounted the greatest indecorum that could possibly exist, but from the scarcity
of slaves during late years [Polack wrote in 1840], or rather from the profits accruing
from their employment in rearing pigs, and planting provisions, cutting timber, and
cleaning flax for their numerous European visitors (their services being at a premium),
these butcheries … have ceased”<a class="noteRef" id="n412.1src" href="#n412.1">334</a>. Something similar to this may often have taken place.
</p>
<p>Probably, however, the slave-trade has also had considerable influence. The mere fact
that foreigners purchase or capture slaves from savage tribes cannot, of course, account
<span class="pageNum" id="pb413">[<a href="#pb413">413</a>]</span>for the existence of slavery among these savages; it may even result in the disappearance
of slavery among them, if they find it more profitable to sell their slaves than retain
them. But the slave-trade will often augment the opportunities of acquiring slaves.
Slave-traders generally trade in other articles besides slaves; therefore they will
often exchange some of the slaves they may have procured for something else. If some
slaves are too weak to perform the journey to the coast, it is more profitable to
sell them in the interior than to leave them behind. Moreover, the slave-traders often
induce savages to make raids upon their neighbours and sell the captives they may
secure; and if a savage chief has once learned in this way to kidnap slaves, he will
perhaps continue to do so though there be not always a ready sale for them. In a word,
the procuring of slaves becomes much easier.
</p>
<p>Now we must bear in mind that an institution does not always exist in all countries
where it would be economically useful. Not only is an institution which would further
the public welfare often wanting, because the immediate interests of individuals are
not concerned, but the individuals are not always aware even of their own immediate
interests. Such may also be the case with slavery. It may be that, if slavery were
introduced into some savage tribe, the tribe, or at least some members of the tribe,
would profit by it, and that yet no slaves are made because there are not sufficiently
strong motives for doing so, or because there are stronger motives working in the
opposite direction. Tribes which have never kept slaves and are unacquainted with
slave-keeping tribes, do not know the use of slavery; therefore they have to come
to it gradually. Taking for granted that the first source of slavery, as seems very
likely, was captivity in war, and that the captives, at first adopted, were afterwards
differentiated from the main body of citizens, we can understand why slavery does
not exist in all countries where the keeping of slaves would be profitable. It may
be that it is the custom to eat the prisoners, or to sacrifice them, or to restore
them when peace is concluded. It may also be that the adopted prisoners have from
times immemorial been regarded as the equals of the tribesmen. In all these cases
the new motive, <span class="pageNum" id="pb414">[<a href="#pb414">414</a>]</span>the want of slaves, must be strong if it is to break through the established custom.
The <i lang="la">vis inertiae</i> plays a great part in the history of mankind.
</p>
<p>Returning to the slave-trade, we may remark that this entirely overturns the existing
state of things. It enables the tribe to procure slaves who are not captives, and
regarding whom therefore no custom has been established. Moreover, the tribe becomes
acquainted with the institution of slavery, which it had not seen practised before.
Now there is no longer any reason why the members of such a tribe should not purchase
the slaves offered to them and set them to work. An external cause has sufficed to
disturb the former equilibrium.
</p>
<p>We have remarked before that the slave-trade facilitates the keeping of slaves, because
purchased slaves are less likely to escape than captives<a class="noteRef" id="n414.1src" href="#n414.1">335</a>. Here too we have to deal with the <i lang="la">vis inertiae</i> rather than with an impossibility in the strict sense of keeping slaves. It will
not, probably, often be the case that agricultural savages would be quite unable to
retain their slaves, if they were really very anxious to keep them; but it may often
occur that they are not yet fully aware of the use of slaves, and therefore do not
want to take the pains of supervising them, though, if slavery were thoroughly established,
it would prove very profitable; in such case the objective want exists, but the subjective
want is not yet felt. In this case, too, the slave-trade, by rendering escape of the
slaves more difficult, will tend to establish the custom of keeping slaves.
</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that slavery existed among some savages who had never had any intercourse
with superior races, but that this intercourse, especially where the slave-trade was
carried on, has often greatly furthered the growth of slavery.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In our chapter on pastoral tribes we have remarked that a tribe living in the vicinity
of inferior races is more likely to keep slaves than one surrounded by tribes of the
same or a higher level of culture. Enslavement of lower races also frequently <span class="pageNum" id="pb415">[<a href="#pb415">415</a>]</span>occurs among agriculturists; but the agriculturists of the higher races (<i>e.g.</i> Malays in the restricted sense, inhabitants of North Africa, etc.) are to be called
barbarians rather than savages and have therefore been excluded from the survey of
slavery given in our first Part.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Briefly recapitulating the conclusions we have arrived at with regard to agricultural
tribes, we have to remark that the general character of their economic and social
life is favourable to the existence of slavery: subsistence is easy to procure, and
independent of capital, except where cattle are kept.
</p>
<p>This applies especially to true agriculturists (agriculturists of the higher stages)
as opposed to hunting agriculturists. The latter bear much resemblance to true hunters,
who hardly ever keep slaves, accordingly slavery is not so frequent among them as
among true agriculturists.
</p>
<p>Our general rule, however, requires an important qualification. Where all land has
been appropriated, a class of free labourers commonly exists, and slaves are not wanted.
</p>
<p>We have not entered into a thorough investigation of the influence of secondary or
additional causes. A closer study of this matter will perhaps yield important results.
What we have found with regard to these secondary causes is the following.
</p>
<p>Slaves often perform female labour; on the other hand female labour sometimes serves
as a substitute for slave labour.
</p>
<p>Commercial agricultural tribes are far more likely to keep slaves than agricultural
tribes among which commerce holds a very subordinate place.
</p>
<p>Slaves are sometimes kept for military purposes, or as a mere luxury. These two circumstances,
however, though they often lead to the keeping of a larger number of slaves than would
otherwise be required, have not probably ever given rise to slavery.
</p>
<p>Subjection of tribes as such, which among some pastoral tribes serves as a substitute
for slavery, hardly ever occurs among agricultural tribes, except in Oceania, where
slavery is already absent for the general cause mentioned above, the non-existence
of free land.
</p>
<p>Some external causes we had found before: fixed habitations, <span class="pageNum" id="pb416">[<a href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>living in large groups, preserving of food, and the neighbourhood of inferior races,
call for no special notice here.
</p>
<p>Intercourse with superior races, especially where these carry on the slave-trade,
proves to be a factor greatly furthering the growth of slavery.
</p>
<p>We shall not give here a list of the causes found up to the present. We think it more
convenient to place such a list at the end of our general survey.

slavery and land tenure. Every one does not want to take land into cultivation, though
he may do so without any payment. On the other hand, where there are people destitute
of land, it is not certain that they serve the landowners and so make slavery superfluous.
It may be that, though they own no land, they have other resources to live upon, or
that they are not apt to perform such work as is most wanted by the rich, etc.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n346.7src">136</a></span> We have not spoken of landed property among hunters, because there are reasons enough
to be found, apart from the appropriation of the land, why slavery is not likely to
exist among them. We will only remark here that among many Australian tribes property
in land is stated to exist (see Dargun, pp. 49, 50). Sometimes even the whole of the
land seems to be held as property. “It seems curious” says Macgillivray “to find at
Cape York and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>Prince of Wales’ Islands a recognised division and ownership of land, seeing that
none of it by cultivation has been rendered fit for the permanent support of man.
According to Gi’om, there are laws regulating the ownership of every inch of ground
on Muralug and the neighbouring possessions of the Kowraregas and I am led to believe
such is likewise the case at Cape York.” Macgillivray, as quoted by Haddon, p 432.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n346.7src" title="Return to note 136 in text.">↑</a></p>

</p>
<p class="footnote cont">It may be of some interest to point out the great resemblance between the rise of
Roman <i lang="la">colonatus</i> as described by Max Weber and the rise of serfdom in Eastern Germany. In both countries
most of the peasants were originally free (Weber, <span lang="de">Römische Agrargeschichte</span>, p. 244; Knapp, I p. 32). The landlords, who formerly had passed most of their time
outside their properties, when they lost their military function took the cultivation
of their manors into their own hands (Weber, l.c., pp. 243, 244; Knapp, I p. 37).
They soon acquired rights of jurisdiction over the peasants (Weber, l.c., p. 260;
Knapp, I p. 33), and began to compel them to work on the demesne (Weber, l.c., p.
244; Knapp, I p. 40). The cultivators lost the right of emigrating (Weber, l.c., pp.
256–258; Knapp, I p. 42). Even the <i lang="de">Bauernlegen</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the joining of a peasant’s holding to the demesne, occurred in Rome as well as in
Eastern Germany (Weber, l. c, p. 247; Knapp, I pp. 50, 55). And it is most remarkable
that in both countries the rise of serfdom took place at an advanced period of their
history.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">This proves once more that the institutions of different countries may closely resemble
<span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>each other, even in many details, without the one country having derived its institutions
from the other. For even the influence of Roman law cannot serve as an explanation
of this resemblance, as Roman law takes little notice of <i lang="la">colonatus</i> (Weber l.c., p. 259).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n382.3src" title="Return to note 252 in text.">↑</a></p>

<div class="fndiv" id="n383.1">
<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n383.1src">253</a></span> We must admit that we are not sure whether the facts of Roman agrarian history agree
with our theory. In Rome slavery prevailed to a large extent at a time when the relative
scarcity of land gave rise to the difficulties about the <i lang="la">ager publicus</i>.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">We shall not attempt to solve this question. We will only mention our impression,
on reading Weber’s <i lang="de">Römische Agrargeschichte</i>, viz. that, even in the time of the Empire, though some land fetched a high price,
all disposable land had not yet been appropriated, and therefore the want of servile
labour remained. At the beginning of the Empire free labourers were very scarce, and
could only be got to help the landlords in sowing and at harvest time on condition
of receiving a pretty considerable part of the harvest (Weber, l.c., pp. 236–238).
Under Augustus and Tiberius the procuring of slaves from abroad became very difficult,
and this led to kidnapping of men by the landlords (Ibid., p. 242). In the boundary
provinces, even in later centuries, barbarians were imported and became <i lang="la">coloni</i> attached to the soil (Ibid., pp. 259, 260).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Slavery proper declined from the beginning of the Empire (Meyer, <span lang="de">Altertum</span>, p. 71); but the <i lang="la">coloni</i>, who originally seem to have been free tenants, gradually lost the right of removing
from the manor they inhabited (Weber, l.c., pp. 242, 248–250, 256–258).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">We must, however, bear in mind that the writers on the economic history of Rome still
disagree very much, not only as to the explanation of the facts, but as to the facts
themselves. See Max Weber’s article on “<span lang="de">Agrarverhältnisse im Altertum</span>”, in <span lang="de">Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</span>, 3rd edition, Vol. I.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n383.1src" title="Return to note 253 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n383.2src">254</a></span> The reader will remember that there are tribes among which land is abundant, but nobody
can live upon land and human labour only: the possession of capital is necessary,
and those destitute of capital have to apply to the owners for employment. The best
instance is furnished by the pastoral tribes.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">We have purposely avoided speaking of countries in which all land has been appropriated
<span class="pageNum" id="pb384">[<a href="#pb384">384</a>]</span>and capital also plays a great part, as it is the case in the manufacturing countries
of modern Europe. Here the structure of society is very complicated and difficult
to disentangle. We think, however, that here also the most important fact is the appropriation
of the soil.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n383.2src" title="Return to note 254 in text.">↑</a></p>

the benefits. The waters of rivers, and of the sea, by the power which they have of
giving movement to our machines, carrying our boats, nourishing our fish, have also
a productive power; the wind which turns our mills, and even the heat of the sun,
work for us; but happily no one has yet been able to say, the wind and the sun are

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The causes which lead to the keeping of slaves, and those which prevent it, have been
divided by us into <i>internal and external causes</i>. These terms do not perhaps quite answer the purpose, but we cannot find other terms
which would express our meaning better, without requiring a prolix circumlocution.
We think, however, that it is clear what we mean by these terms. Slavery cannot exist,
where there are no internal causes requiring it, <i>i.e.</i> where there is no use, economic or non-economic, for slave labour. A tribe will not
keep slaves, even though its coercive power would enable it to do so, if there is
no employment for them; in such case positive internal causes fail. The same obtains,
where definite internal causes are found, which make slave labour useless<a class="noteRef" id="n417.1src" href="#n417.1">1</a>. The positive internal causes may also be called motive-forces. Slaves will not be
kept, even where the best opportunities of procuring them exist, if there is no motive-force
which requires the keeping of slaves, <i>i.e.</i> if they are not wanted.
</p>
<p>But though, where motives for keeping slaves fail, no external causes will give rise
to slavery,—even when there are such motives, slavery will not exist, if there are
no external causes rendering it possible, <i>i.e.</i> if there is no opportunity of procuring and retaining slaves. Where neither capture
<span class="pageNum" id="pb418">[<a href="#pb418">418</a>]</span>or purchase of aliens, nor enslavement of members of the tribe is practicable, or
where the slaves can very easily escape, slaves cannot be kept, though there might
be much use for them<a class="noteRef" id="n418.1src" href="#n418.1">2</a>.
</p>
<p>The principal internal cause which prevents the rise of slavery, or where slavery
exists, tends to make it disappear, is the dependence of subsistence upon closed resources.
The most important result of our investigation seems to us the division, not only
of all savage tribes, but of all peoples of the earth, into peoples with <i>open</i>, and with <i>closed resources</i>. Among the former labour is the principal factor of production, and a man who does
not possess anything but his own strength and skill, is able to provide for himself
independently of any capitalist or landlord. There may be capital which enhances the
productiveness of labour, and particularly fertile or favourably situated grounds
the ownership of which gives great advantage; but a man can do without these advantages.
Among peoples with closed resources it is otherwise. Here subsistence is dependent
upon material resources of which there is only a limited supply, and which accordingly
have all been appropriated. These resources can consist in capital, the supply of
which is always limited; then those who own no capital are dependent on the capitalists.
They can also consist in land. Such is the case when all land has been appropriated;
then people destitute of land are dependent on the landowners.
</p>
<p>Where subsistence depends on closed resources, slaves may occasionally be kept, but
slavery as an industrial system is not likely to exist. There are generally poor people
who voluntarily offer themselves as labourers; therefore slavery, <i>i.e.</i> a system of compulsory labour, is not wanted. And even where there are no poor men,
because all share in the closed resources, the use of slaves cannot be great. Where
there are practically unlimited resources, a man can, by increasing the number of
his slaves, increase his income to any extent; but a man who owns a limited capital,
or a limited quantity of land, can only employ a limited number of labourers. Moreover,
as soon as in a country with closed resources slaves are kept, they form a class destitute
of capital, or land, as the case may be; <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>therefore, even when they are set free, they will remain in the service of the rich,
as they are unable to provide for themselves<a class="noteRef" id="n419.1src" href="#n419.1">3</a>. The rich have no interest to keep the labourers in a slave-like state. It may even
be their interest to set them free, either in order to deprive them of such rights
over the land as they may have acquired in the course of time, or to bring about a
determination of the wages of labour by the law of supply and demand, instead of by
custom. They will thus, without any compulsion except that exercized by the automatic
working of the social system, secure a larger share in the produce of labour than
they got before by compulsion.
</p>
<p>Among peoples with open resources everybody is able to provide for himself; therefore
free labourers do not offer themselves, at least not for employment in the common
drudgery, the rudest and most despised work. There may be, and indeed there often
are, skilled labourers whose work is highly valued and well paid; such people think
it more profitable to earn their livelihood by means of their peculiar talents, than
in the common way. A striking instance of this is the priest, whom we may call a skilled
labourer performing non-economic labour; his <span class="corr" id="xd32e20128" title="Source: renumeration">remuneration</span>, both in material goods and in influence and consideration, is greater than the income
of a common agriculturist. But there are no labourers in the modern sense of proletarians,
destitute of everything and obliged to seek employment in whatever work they can find.
If therefore a man wants others to perform the necessary drudgery for him, and cannot
impose it upon his wife, or wives, or other female dependents (either because women
hold a high position, or because there is more mean work to be done than the women
can possibly manage), he must compel other men to serve him; and this compulsion will
often assume the form of slavery.
</p>
<p>In the first Part we have said that a slave is a man who is the property of another.
We can now see the practical meaning of this definition. In slave countries labourers
are held as property, and valued as such. If an employer loses a labourer, his income
is lessened by it; if his labourer runs away, he eagerly tries to recover him. In
countries with closed resources it is <span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span>quite the reverse<a class="noteRef" id="n420.1src" href="#n420.1">4</a>. The labourers are not held as property, because they are not valued. If a labourer
leaves his service, the employer knows that there are many others ready to take his
place. Here it is not the employer who prevents his labourers from escaping, but the
employed who try to prevent the employer from dismissing his workmen. We are, of course,
aware that labour is always an indispensable factor of production; yet in many countries,
<i>e.g.</i> in modern Western Europe, an employer does not care to keep a particular labourer
in his service<a class="noteRef" id="n420.2src" href="#n420.2">5</a>. We must, however, bear in mind that this rule, in its strictest sense, applies only
to unskilled labour. Qualified labourers are often highly valued and able to secure
great advantage, because their number is limited. It is therefore that the helpless
state of people destitute of material resources appears more clearly in agricultural
than in manufacturing countries.
</p>
<p>This difference between countries with open and with closed resources goes far to
explain why slavery (and serfdom, which is also a form of compulsory labour) has gradually
disappeared in civilized Europe, whereas in thinly peopled countries it maintained
itself much longer, and even now is sometimes introduced under some disguise (“labour
trade”, convict labour and similar expedients used in the tropics). In Western Europe
unskilled labourers can always be had without compulsion, whereas the qualities required
in skilled labourers cannot develop under a compulsory <i>régime</i>.
</p>
<p>Always and everywhere have men been inclined to burden their fellow-men with heavy
and disagreeable work rather than <span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span>perform it themselves; and the strong have succeeded in imposing this work on the
weak. Among some savage tribes it is the weaker sex who perform the drudgery; but
in the course of progress the work that has to be done soon becomes too much for the
women to manage. Then subjection of males arises, which presents itself in various
forms, as subjugation of conquered tribes, or of the common people by the king and
nobility, but often also as slavery or serfdom. Finally, when indispensable resources
have been appropriated, the meanest labour is imposed upon those who are destitute
of land and capital. <i>There is now no longer a personal, but an impersonal compulsion.</i> Lange remarks: “In former times the marauding minority of mankind, by means of physical
violence, compelled the working majority to render feudal services, or reduced them
to a state of slavery or serfdom, or at least made them pay a tribute. Nowadays the
dependence of the working classes is secured in a less direct but equally efficacious
manner, viz. by means of the superior power of capital; the labourer being forced,
in order to get his subsistence, to place his labour power entirely at the disposal
of the capitalist. So there is a semblance of liberty; but in reality the labourer
is exploited and subjected, because, all the land having been appropriated, he cannot
procure his subsistence directly from nature, and, goods being produced for the market
and not for the producer’s own use, he cannot subsist without capital. Wages will
rise above what is wanted for the necessaries of life, where the labourer is able
to earn his subsistence on free land, which has not yet become private property. But
wherever, in an old and totally occupied country, a body of labouring poor is employed
in manufactures, the same law, which we see at work in the struggle for life throughout
the organized world, will keep wages at the absolute minimum”<a class="noteRef" id="n421.1src" href="#n421.1">6</a>.
</p>
<p>Little credit is given at present to the opinion expressed in the last sentence, all
economists being aware that the wages, not only of the skilled, but even of the unskilled
workmen are in many cases above the bare minimum. But this much seems true, that in
countries, where all the land is held as private <span class="pageNum" id="pb422">[<a href="#pb422">422</a>]</span>property, labour is at a discount. We may even say, though it sounds strange, that
generally labour is much more at a disadvantage in countries where slavery does not
exist, than in slave countries. In slave countries labourers are naturally independent;
therefore he who wants to make another work for him, must enslave him and resort to
all possible means of retaining him in his service. Hence the strange compound of
severity and indulgence that has so often been observed among slave-owners. In countries
with closed resources the landlord or capitalist has a natural advantage over his
labourers; he need neither use severity nor indulgence to maintain his position.
</p>
<p>The condition of the working classes in modern Europe in many respects certainly is
not better than that of the slaves in countries of lower civilization. We cannot deny
the truth of the remark made by the intelligent chief of the Fulbe, whom Hecquard
met on his travels in West Africa. “We often” says Hecquard “talked about our mode
of government and the relation of the different classes in European society. He did
not attach any value to the legal equality of the citizens and asked me how my countrymen
got on without slaves. His conclusion was that with us the domestics and the poor
classes in general were the slaves of the rich, because the latter could, by refusing
to give them work, reduce them to starvation in a country, where nothing is given
gratuitously”<a class="noteRef" id="n422.1src" href="#n422.1">7</a>.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>We have seen that slavery cannot exist to any considerable extent among peoples with
closed resources. But even among peoples with open resources it is not always found.
Slaves perform the drudgery for their masters; therefore they are not wanted where
little drudgery has to be done, or in other terms, slavery is not likely to exist
where <i>subsistence</i> is <i>difficult to acquire</i>. Where men subsist by highly skilled labour, there can be little use for slaves;
for the slaves cannot be made to perform such labour; and the little unskilled labour
that is wanted is not profitable enough to admit of the keeping of slaves, who would
have to be fed by the produce of their <span class="pageNum" id="pb423">[<a href="#pb423">423</a>]</span>masters’ work. This is the principal reason why slavery hardly ever occurs among hunters,
and one of the reasons why the Eskimos do not keep slaves.
</p>
<p>We find thus that, generally speaking, the keeping of slaves is economically profitable
to peoples with open resources among which subsistence is easily acquired, and to
such peoples only. But there are several <i>secondary causes</i>, internal and external, which bring about that slaves are sometimes kept by peoples
with closed resources, or by peoples among which subsistence is difficult to procure,
and that on the other hand slavery is sometimes absent where resources are open and
subsistence is easy to acquire.
</p>
<p>Among the <i>secondary internal causes</i> we have noted in the first place the <i>condition of women</i>. There is no use for slaves, where all disagreeable work can be, and is performed
by the weaker sex; Australian and Melanesian women supply the place of slaves. On
the other hand, where the women hold a high position, and the men are desirous of
relieving them of a part of their task, slavery is likely to arise sooner than otherwise
would be the case.
</p>
<p><i>Commerce</i> probably exists among all savages. Even the Australian tribes mutually exchange rare
kinds of earth for painting their bodies, and similar objects. But commerce has only
a social importance, where the articles exchanged are manufactured goods in the widest
sense, including <i>e.g.</i> fish and agricultural products, in a word all articles the production of which requires
a considerable amount of labour. Then the freemen who devote themselves to commercial
pursuits want others to perform the common labour for every-day subsistence; moreover
the preparing of the articles of trade requires more labour than would otherwise be
wanted. And last, but not least, commerce leads to the development of wealth and luxury;
slave labour is now wanted to provide the owner not only with the necessaries, but
with the comforts of life. Commercial tribes in the widest sense,—including 1º tribes
which exchange native produce for foreign manufactures, 2º tribes which themselves
produce and export manufactured goods in the common, restricted<span class="corr" id="xd32e20196" title="Source: .">,</span> sense, 3º tribes which carry on a transit-trade,—are therefore far more likely to
keep slaves than <span class="corr" id="xd32e20199" title="Source: selfsufficing">self-sufficing</span> tribes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have seen that subjection of women is sometimes a substitute for slavery. Another
substitute is <i>subjection of tribes</i> as such. This subjection occurs only, so far as savages are concerned, where peculiar
circumstances render it possible: among pastoral tribes, which subject their neighbours
to whom they are superior in military qualities, and in Oceania, where the limited
area prevents the conquered from receding. Where a tribe subjected as such pays a
tribute to the conquerors and performs services for them, there is not so much need
for enslavement of individuals belonging to the vanquished tribe.
</p>
<p>People who live from hand to mouth have less use for slaves than those who <i>preserve food</i> for the time of scarcity. The preparing of this food may require much labour which
is very fit to be performed by slaves. We have seen that such is especially the case
on the North Pacific Coast of North America.
</p>
<p>Slaves are sometimes kept for <i>non-economic purposes</i>.
</p>
<p><i>Warfare</i> plays a great part in savage life, and we have found that the requirements of warfare
sometimes prevent, but in other cases further the rise of slavery. Many savage tribes
increase their population by introduction of foreign elements. This may be done for
two reasons: men are wanted either for labourers or for warriors<a class="noteRef" id="n424.1src" href="#n424.1">8</a>. In the former case the introduction of aliens leads to slavery in its most general
form of extratribal slavery. When warriors are wanted, slavery is not the most appropriate
form; adoption of foreigners, such as was for instance practised by the Iroquois,
answers the purpose better, because a man who enjoys the common privileges of a member
of the tribe is more reliable in war than a slave. In such case militarism may prevent
the rise of slavery, because all available men are wanted in war and have therefore
to be placed on a level with the tribesmen. But where superior military qualities
of a tribe render the employment of slaves in warfare (most often in the lower ranks
of the army) possible, slaves are sometimes kept mainly for military purposes, especially
<span class="pageNum" id="pb425">[<a href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>where prejudices of race or colour prevent the tribe from adopting the foreigners.
Then militarism furthers the growth of slavery; for slaves would perhaps not be wanted,
if they did not serve as warriors.
</p>
<p>Slaves may also be kept as a mere <i>luxury</i>. The possession of many slaves, like other property, everywhere tends to give the
owner influence and reputation. Yet he most often also derives material profit from
his slaves, namely from the total number of them, even where some of them do not perform
productive labour. Only in a few cases does the sole use of slaves appear to consist
in augmenting their owners’ influence and reputation. This occurs among some pastoral
tribes, where the rich are able to support a large number of unproductive labourers.
But here the military use of slaves has perhaps co-operated in establishing slavery.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of this paragraph we have spoken of <i>external causes</i>.
</p>
<p>It is quite possible that a tribe does not keep slaves, though they would be very
useful. The non-existence of slavery in such cases is due to external circumstances.
It may be that the coercive power of the tribe is not sufficiently developed to admit
of the keeping of slaves. It may also be that slavery does not exist, because it has
not yet been invented: people may have always been accustomed to deal otherwise with
their prisoners than by enslaving them, and so the idea of making slaves may never
have entered their minds. The coercive power is strongest where men live in <i>fixed habitations</i> (though several tribes of pastoral nomads also keep slaves), and in <i>large groups</i>, and are accustomed to <i>preserve food</i>. The <i>slave-trade</i> has considerable influence. It increases the coercive power by rendering escape of
slaves more difficult; and by making a tribe acquainted with the institution of slavery
and providing it with an easy means of acquiring slaves it often overcomes the <i lang="la">vis inertiae</i>. The slave-trade may go far to account for the very frequent <span class="corr" id="xd32e20245" title="Source: occurence">occurrence</span> of slavery among savages who have long maintained relations with superior races,
though due allowance must be made for the influence of the general intercourse with
such races, especially in furthering the commercial development. Another external
cause is the <i>neighbourhood of <span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span>inferior races</i>, the influence of which, as we have seen, clearly appears among pastoral tribes.
It is easier for Hamitic and Semitic nations to keep Negroes in a state of subjection
than people of their own race.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have viewed slavery as an industrial system, and inquired under what economic and
social conditions this system can exist. This investigation we believe has led to
valuable conclusions. But slavery (even if we confine ourselves to slavery among savages)
may be viewed under many more aspects. We have not made any further study of the subject;
but having collected many ethnographical materials, we have become acquainted with
a great number of details which may afford subjects of further investigation. We shall
give here an enumeration of various points connected with slavery, though we do not
claim that it is in any way complete: it would probably appear on closer scrutiny
that many additions could be made to it. We shall mention the various points in short
sentences, often in the form of inquiries.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb428">[<a href="#pb428">428</a>]</span></p>
<div class="div3 section" id="s2.5.2.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">I.</span> <span class="ex">The different ways in which people become slaves.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1º Slaves by birth;
</li>
<li>2º Free-born people who become slaves.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>In connection with the former point it may be inquired what is in each case the status
of children born of two slaves, of a male slave and a free woman, of a female slave
and a free man, and especially of a female slave and her master. This inquiry will
enable us to find, whether and to what extent slaves are merged in the general population.<a class="noteRef" id="n428.1src" href="#n428.1">10</a>
</p>
<p>The manners in which free-born people become slaves may be distinguished according
as slaves are acquired from without or within the limits of the tribe. This reminds
us of the distinction we have made between extratribal and intratribal slavery. We
may inquire then which of these two forms of slavery appears first. If we should find
that extratribal is older than intratribal slavery (which does not seem unlikely),
we might examine the economic and social conditions under which intratribal slavery
can exist.
</p>
<p>Extratribal slaves become such by:
</p>
<p>1º Capture in war or kidnapping. Here a wide field of research opens itself. Captives,
when they are not enslaved, are killed (eaten, sacrificed), or exchanged after peace
has been concluded, or ransomed by their countrymen, or adopted into the tribe of
the captors. It may be inquired whether any of these modes of treatment can have gradually
led to enslavement of the captives (<i>e.g.</i> captives are first adopted, and gradually differentiated from the born members of
the tribe: or they are first eaten, then preserved to be eaten later on and in the
meantime set to work, and finally employed as slaves and no longer eaten)<a class="noteRef" id="n428.2src" href="#n428.2">11</a>. Several of these modes of treatment <span class="pageNum" id="pb429a">[<a href="#pb429a">429</a>]</span>coexist with slavery (<i>e.g.</i> some captives are sacrificed and the rest kept as slaves; or slaves are occasionally
sacrificed); does this only occur in the early stages of slavery, and indicate that
slavery has not yet fully developed? When is slavery an object, and when is it only
an incident of warfare? A remarkable phenomenon, worth a close investigation, is the
occurrence of extratribal slavery or adoption of aliens together with a preventive
check on population (infanticide, abortion)<a class="noteRef" id="n429.2src" href="#n429.2">12</a>. When captives are enslaved, it is worth inquiring in what manner they are distributed
among the captors; this will have a strong influence on the division of wealth.
</p>
<p>2º Purchase. The prices paid for different classes of slaves show what slaves are
most desired (men or women, people of different ages or nationalities). The slaves
sold have often been captured by the sellers; but it also occurs that people are sold
by their countrymen, especially criminals. Here we may notice the influence of the
slave-trade on penal law; people are probably often sold abroad, who otherwise would
have been killed or expelled from the community.
</p>
<p>Intratribal slaves become such (so far as we know) in the following ways:
</p>
<p>1º For non-payment of a debt. Here the general treatment of debtors and the extent
to which the rights of creditors are acknowledged by the community are worth examining.
Debtor-slaves have often, but not always, a right to become free by paying off the
debt<a class="noteRef" id="n429.3src" href="#n429.3">13</a>. In some cases the creditor <span class="pageNum" id="pb430">[<a href="#pb430">430</a>]</span>does not keep the debtor as a slave, but recovers his money by selling him abroad<a class="noteRef" id="n430.1src" href="#n430.1">14</a>.
</p>
<p>2º As a punishment, either directly, or when the <i>wergild</i> is not paid. This subject might be treated in connection with Professor Steinmetz’s
investigations of early penal law. Criminals often become slaves of the chief or king;
a study of this matter would lead to an inquiry into political institutions at large.
</p>
<p>3º By marrying a male or female slave. Here we may inquire where and to what extent
<i lang="la">connubium</i> between free people and slaves exists.
</p>
<p>4º By offering themselves as slaves, or selling themselves. In the former case it
has always carefully to be inquired whether such persons become slaves or voluntary
servants; the latter is quite possible, and the terminology of our informants not
always reliable, as we have seen when speaking of Oceania. When they really become
slaves, there are probably open resources. It is then worth inquiring what can be
the reason why, while resources are open and so everybody is able to provide for himself,
there are people who throw themselves upon the mercy of men of power.
</p>
<p>5º Finally, orphans and other helpless persons are sometimes enslaved.

of slaves, have a right to be redeemed.<a class="noteRef" id="n430.2src" href="#n430.2">15</a>
</p>
<p>2º Emancipation. Where, and under what social conditions does this custom prevail,
and where is it of frequent occurrence? What are the motives that induce the master
to set his slave free? Emancipation as a substitute for sacrifice<a class="noteRef" id="n430.3src" href="#n430.3">16</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb431">[<a href="#pb431">431</a>]</span></p>
<p>3º Adoption. Connected with this is the fact, that in some countries slaves sometimes
succeed to their masters’ goods<a class="noteRef" id="n431.1src" href="#n431.1">17</a>. Here we may ask whether or not such adoption and right of inheritance are only found
in early stages and have to be regarded as survivals of adoption of aliens.
</p>
<p>4º Marriage of a slave with a free person, especially of a female slave with her master.
</p>
<p>5º Dedication to a god. Slaves can sometimes become free by devoting themselves to
some deity<a class="noteRef" id="n431.2src" href="#n431.2">18</a>. Further details; power of the priesthood; compare the influence of the church in
the Middle Ages.
</p>
<p>In whatever way slaves become free, the position of the <i lang="la">liberti</i> deserves a separate consideration. Are they on a level with free-born men, or do
they form a separate class? Do their descendants gradually become merged in the general
population?

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1º Influence of slavery on the social organization of the tribe. A slave-owner, having
labour forces at his command and being supported by a body of followers, is more likely
to attain wealth and consideration than the other freemen. And as in those countries,
where the slave trade is developed, the keeping of slaves may soon become a privilege
of the rich<a class="noteRef" id="n435.3src" href="#n435.3">32</a>, slavery furthers the divergence of the rich and the poor, of the nobles and the
common people.
</p>
<p>2º Connected with this is the influence of slavery on the development of the military
principle. The ruling classes, having learned to command their slaves, are more capable
of commanding the people.
</p>
<p>3º Influence of slavery on the laws and customs regulating marriage, and on sexual
morality at large. Female slaves serving as concubines<span id="xd32e20660"></span><a class="noteRef" id="n435.4src" href="#n435.4">33</a>.
</p>
<p>4º Influence of slavery on the condition of free women. When there are many domestic
slaves, free women are no longer overtaxed with work<span id="xd32e20666"></span><a class="noteRef" id="n435.5src" href="#n435.5">34</a>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>5º Influence of slavery on warfare. As soon as captives are regularly enslaved, the
cruel modes of treating captives which may have formerly existed disappear. On the
other hand, when the procuring of slaves becomes an object of warfare, war becomes
much more frequent than before<a class="noteRef" id="n436.1src" href="#n436.1">35</a>.
</p>
<p>6º Influence of slavery on the development of the political power of the tribe. Slavery
“creates a set of persons born to work that others may not work, and not to think
in order that others may think. Therefore slave-owning nations, having time to think,
are likely to be more shrewd in policy, and more crafty in strategy”<a class="noteRef" id="n436.2src" href="#n436.2">36</a>.
</p>
<p>7º Slavery has a great influence on morality at large, in a good as well as in a bad
sense.
</p>
<p>Slavery has played a great part in the education of mankind. Ingram rightly remarks
that “slavery discharged important offices … by forcing the captives, who with their
descendants came to form the majority of the conquering community, to a life of industry
in spite of the antipathy to regular and sustained labour which is deeply rooted in
human nature, especially in the earlier stages of the social movement, when insouciance
is so common a trait, and irresponsibility is hailed as a welcome relief”<a class="noteRef" id="n436.3src" href="#n436.3">37</a>.
</p>
<p>Moreover, slavery affords to the higher classes a leisure, that enables them to reach
the higher grades of culture, which would be inaccessible to them, if they had to
work for their daily wants<a class="noteRef" id="n436.4src" href="#n436.4">38</a>.
</p>
<p>A bad effect of slavery is that manual labour is identified with slave labour and
so discredited<a class="noteRef" id="n436.5src" href="#n436.5">39</a>.
</p>
<p>Other bad effects of slavery are mentioned by Ingram. The habit of absolute rule corrupts
the masters. Slavery often <span class="pageNum" id="pb437">[<a href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>engenders cruelty, or at least harshness. The slaves are demoralized, because their
education is neglected and they do not live in normal family relations. Slavery moreover
prevents “the development of the sense of human dignity, which lies at the foundation
of morals”<a class="noteRef" id="n437.1src" href="#n437.1">40</a>.
</p>
<p>8º Influence of slavery on the intermingling of races. “The blending of types” says
Brinton “was greatly accelerated in early days by the institution or human slavery”<a class="noteRef" id="n437.2src" href="#n437.2">41</a>.
</p>
<p>9º Selective influence of slavery. Ferrero’s theory: slavery has greatly furthered
the survival of the industrious type of man<a class="noteRef" id="n437.3src" href="#n437.3">42</a>. Ripley, speaking of colonial slavery, remarks: “Such an institution exercises a
selective choice upon the negro; for the survivors of such severe treatment will generally
be a picked lot, which ought to exhibit vitality to a marked degree, all the weaklings
having been removed”<a class="noteRef" id="n437.4src" href="#n437.4">43</a>. High death-rate among slaves, even in primitive culture<a class="noteRef" id="n437.5src" href="#n437.5">44</a>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though we have not systematically investigated this subject, our studies have brought
us into closer connection with this than with any of the points mentioned above. We
shall therefore briefly state our impressions on the development of slavery, without,
of course, claiming for the following remarks the value of a theory.
</p>
<p>Slavery very probably first appears in the form of extratribal slavery, and originates
from the adoption of captives, especially captive children. This is also Powell’s
opinion. According to him captive children were originally adopted and treated by
the captors entirely as their own children. “This <span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span>is not yet slavery. If the captive belongs to a tribe of hereditary enemies who have
from time immemorial been designated by some opprobrious term, as cannibals, liars,
snakes, etc.—then it may be that the captive is doomed to perpetual younger brotherhood,
and can never exercise authority over any person within the tribe, though such person
may be born after the new birth of the captive. This is the first form of slavery.
Usually, though not invariably, the captives adopted are children”<a class="noteRef" id="n438.1src" href="#n438.1">45</a>. Whether the first slaves were really captives belonging to a tribe of hereditary
enemies, we do not know; but Powell expresses himself very appropriately, when he
says that the slaves are “doomed to perpetual younger brotherhood”. In the early stages
of culture slaves are on the whole leniently treated, and there is little difference
between young slaves and free children. But the slave always remains a “younger brother”.
He never becomes the head of a family; and when the master who educated him dies,
he becomes the subject of the master’s child, who has been the companion of his childhood.
The slave does not count among the full-grown men of the tribe; he is not allowed
to bear arms, he has no voice in government matters; though a member, he is an inferior
member of the household in which he lives.
</p>
<p>This is the first stage of differentiation between freemen and slaves.
</p>
<p>The slaves are children captured in war<a class="noteRef" id="n438.2src" href="#n438.2">46</a>, their number is small. The slave, who is nearly on a level with the children, is
wanted for much the same reason why children are so eagerly desired among most agricultural
savage tribes: the larger the family, the more food can be produced; for land is still
abundant. Slaves and freemen perform the same kind of work, with the exception perhaps
of some domestic occupations, which are more and more left to the slaves.
</p>
<p>Gradually the number of slaves increases. The slave-trade greatly furthers the growth
of slavery. The keeping of slaves <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>is more and more confined to the chiefs and principal men. Where slaves are captured
in war it is the leading men who secure most of the spoils; and where slaves are purchased
it is only the rich who can give a good price for them. The ruling classes are the
great slave-owners, and these men are naturally inclined to leave all the common work
to their slaves, reserving for themselves only the noble pursuits of warfare and government.
The difference between the slaves and their owners becomes thus greater than it was
before. The common people come to distrust and hate the slaves, whom they regard as
the tools of the aristocracy. And the differentiating process we have described here
is always going on: the more slaves a man owns, the greater his wealth; and the greater
a man’s wealth the better will he be able to procure slaves. The common people are
continually sinking in the social scale, and in the course of time many of them are
reduced to slavery for non-payment of money they have borrowed from the rich.
</p>
<p>The further development of slavery can proceed in two different ways.
</p>
<p>In some countries, where oil, cotton, and similar products are exported, slavery assumes
enormous proportions. The large plantations can best be worked with slaves; and as
manufactured goods are imported, slave labour serves not only to feed the master,
but to provide him with the luxuries of life; the wants of the slave-owners, and accordingly
the possible extent of slavery, become practically unlimited. This slave system, as
we have seen, exists in some parts of the West Coast of Africa, and bears a close
resemblance to that which till far into the 19<sup>th</sup> century was carried on in the Southern States of North America.
</p>
<p>Where cereals are grown and agricultural produce is not exported on a very large scale,
the course of things is different. An increase of slaves above a certain number is
of little use to the owner. When he has slaves enough to provide him with a large
quantity of food and other necessaries for the use of himself and his family and personal
servants, he does not want more slaves. The agricultural produce they could furnish
would not be worth the pains of supervising them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb440">[<a href="#pb440">440</a>]</span>The slaves (except a few who are kept for domestic services) are soon allowed to live
rather independently, bound only to provide fixed quantities of agricultural produce
and perform occasional services. And when the use of money becomes general, these
slaves often contract with their masters to pay a yearly tribute in money instead
of the services and payments in kind. The slaves become serfs. And gradually the whole
of the lower orders are merged in this servile class. Ancient slaves, members of subjected
communities, helpless persons who seek the protection of a powerful chief, all become
the subjects and dependents of the ruling nobles. Such was the social system of the
early Middle Ages, that in the course of time was entirely overturned through the
progress of manufactures and commerce and the gradual appropriation of the whole of
the land<a class="noteRef" id="n440.1src" href="#n440.1">47</a>.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n420.2src">5</a></span> We have repeatedly remarked that the condition of countries with open resources is
quite different: land is abundant, but the supply of labour is limited; therefore
the ruling classes attach little value to land as such, but their chief aim is to
people the land with men who enter into their service. A good instance is given by
Junod in his account of the Baronga (near Delagoa Bay): “According to their laws,
the soil belongs exclusively to the chief. But practically it belongs to every one.
Nobody buys land. It is given gratuitously to whosoever wants to settle in the country.
By simply declaring himself a subject of the chief, a native may acquire as much land
as he wants for his subsistence.” (Junod, pp. 186, 187).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n420.2src" title="Return to note 5 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n427.1src">9</a></span> Dr. Vierkandt, reviewing the first edition of this work, remarks that there is no
internal connection between the results of the investigation and the distinction of
economic groups, as the existence or non-existence of slavery appears to depend not
only on the economic state of society, but on many causes which have little to do
with this state.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Though we fully admit this last, we think our division of the savage tribes into economic
groups is justified by the results of our investigation. This division has led us
to the following conclusions. Hunters and fishers, and equally the lowest agricultural
group, as Dr. Vierkandt himself observes, generally do not keep slaves. The state
of pastoral nomadism is also unfavourable to the growth of slavery. On the other hand,
agriculturists of the higher stages are very likely to keep slaves.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Having arrived at these preliminary results, we have inquired which causes engender
this connection between slavery and the economic state of society. We have also asked
for the causes of the exceptions to the rules above mentioned. So we have come to
an understanding of the internal connection between slavery and the other factors
of social life. We cannot think our final results would have been obtained as well
in any other way.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n427.1src" title="Return to note 9 in text.">↑</a></p>

no slaves were sacrificed but the old and sickly and those who, being defective in
some way or other, caused their master more trouble than profit. Except at the great
feasts slaves were scarcely ever killed; for they were valuable and difficult to replace.
(Holmberg, I p. 51). We see that the keeping of slaves had become profitable and so

is the prevailing custom. When a man needs assistance in his declining years, his
props are not his own sons but youths obtained by purchase from the St. Christoval
natives who, as they attain to manhood, acquire a virtual independence, passing almost
beyond the control of their original owner. It is from this cause that but a small
proportion of the Ugi natives have been born on the island, three-fourths of them
having been brought as youths to supply the place of offspring killed in infancy”.

speaking, slaves do not care to be free, for they are treated as members of the family
and are so contented that they do not long for a change in their condition.” Herold,
p. 170. The slaves, formerly kept by the Koniagas, evidently thought otherwise of
their servile state: for on the arrival of the Russians, many slaves took refuge to
them (Holmberg I p. 79).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n434.3src" title="Return to note 29 in text.">↑</a></p>

sold to the hill people, however unfairly, he is restricted on his return from associating
with his countrymen as their equal, unless he brings with him a sum of money, and
pays a fine for his re-enfranchisement to his kalippah or chief. This regulation has
taken its rise from an idea of contamination among the people, and from art and avarice
among the chiefs.” Marsden, p. 255. Similarly, among the Maori, according to Polack
(II p. 55), “chiefs who have tasted of slavery are often taunted by their friends,
by whom they may have been ransomed, as having been slaves.” Brown (New Zealand, p.
62) remarks: “They attach great importance to the circumstance of never having been
taken in war.”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n435.2src" title="Return to note 31 in text.">↑</a></p>

remarks: “In those places where the slave-buying still goes on, the people are more
disposed to go to war, to convict criminals, and to make use of any pretence to procure
slaves. And it is also certain that there are regions where an almost constant war
is carried on for the purpose of obtaining slaves” (Winwood Reade, p. 291).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n436.1src" title="Return to note 35 in text.">↑</a></p>

in its more advanced stages. Yet even the patriarchal slave system of primitive societies
sometimes has a bad influence on the slaves. Polack, speaking of the New Zealand slaves,
remarks: “Debarred from the sight of their relatives, they become reckless of moral
feeling.… Obscenity and lying are among the practices most persisted in by the slaves,
and to their demoralized state may be attributed the greater part of the wars and
dissensions of this irritable people; they may be justly regarded as the greatest
drawback to the prosperity and civilization hitherto of the New Zealanders” (Polack,
II pp. 58, 59).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n437.1src" title="Return to note 40 in text.">↑</a></p>

This is the case even among the semi-civilized Mohammedans of Baghirmi: see Nachtigal,
II p. 615. The North African slave-hunters, according to Goldstein (p. 367), have
a preference for girls, but also capture boys; full-grown men, however, are generally

Athens”. Cunningham, Western Civilization, pp. 66, 110. But we think such an employment
